    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the need to consider the use of multipurpose cement composite (CC) in the construction industry to give superior performance. Therefore, incorporating nanomaterials (NMs) can improve the perfor-mance and characteristics of CC. Hence, the use of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) in the composite matrix can be a viable way to address the challenges towards achieving a sustainable, with superior properties. In addition, forecasting the properties of NMs is a challenging task due to nature of ambiguity between parameters, complex nature, and non-linear response to strength. In addition, strength evaluation is time consuming process. Thus, there is a needs for predictive models to estimate strength of NMs. This study employee four machine learning (ML) approaches namely as light gradient boosting (LGB), artificial neural network (ANN), gradient boosting (GB), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) with hyper-tuning, and optimization. In addition, model evaluation is judge by statistical measures, uncertainty analysis, and tenfold approach is applied for validation of the model. Moreover, graphical user interface (GUI) is developed for practical implementation to estimate strength. The result reveals that XGB, and ANN model shows robust analysis with greater R2 > 0.90 for both train and test sets with XGB perform better as compared to ANN and other models. XGB depicts lesser statistical index, and un-certainty analysis demonstrates all model with less level of ambiguity for train and test set. The train and test set for XGB, LGB, KNN, and ANN models demonstrate 7.668 %, 8.9 %, 8.9 %, 17.18 %, 9.85 %, 20.61, and 5 %, 14.74 %, respectively. Shapley analysis reveals that GNP thickness, diameter and curing have major contribution to strength."

        "abstract": "The world is rich in marine resources, and the use of seawater, sea sand and coral instead of fresh water, river sand and gravel can solve problems such as the scarcity of traditional materials for marine engineering construction. Additionally, fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars have demonstrated excellent corrosion resistance performance, which can effectively solve the problem of the corrosion of steel in harsh marine environments. To study the bond performance between FRP bars and sea sand coral concrete (SSCC), 72 specimens of direct Pull-out were designed, and relevant tests were carried out to explore the effects of fibre types, bar diameters, bond lengths and SSCC strength grades. The results show that the bond strength between carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) bars and SSCC was higher than that of basalt fibre-reinforced polymer (BFRP) bars and glass fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars. The splitting damage pattern occurred in most of the specimens; the bond strength between FRP bars and SSCC decreased with increasing diameter and bond length of FRP bars but increased with increasing SSCC strength grade. As a result, by fitting the bond-slip curves obtained from the tests, the bond-slip constitutive relationship between FRP bars and SSCC specimens was obtained, which clearly and precisely represents the bond failure process of SSCC with FRP bar reinforcement.",

The mechanical properties are experimentally investigated based on various combined loading cases. A total of nine square RC columns with identical structural properties are produced, and five of them are corroded and poststrengthened with BSP and HPFL. The effects of the combined loadings, bearing capacity, failure mode, skeleton curves, hysteretic curves, ductility, stiffness degradation, energy dissipation, and plastic hinge characteristics are analyzed. In particular, a new method for calculating the skeleton curves under different failures modes is proposed and agrees well with the experimental results by comparison.",

In this study, machine learning approaches and artificial intelligence python‐based approaches have been utilized to predict the mechanical behaviour of HSC. The data to be used in the modelling consist of several input parameters such as cement, water, fine aggregate, and coarse aggregate in combination with a superplasticizer. Empirical relation with mathematical expression has been proposed using engineering programming. The efficiency of the models is assessed by statistical analysis with the error by using MAE, RRMSE, RSE, and comparisons were made between regression models. Moreover, variable intensity and correlation have shown that deep learning can be used to know the exact amount of materials in civil engineering rather than doing experimental work. The expression tree, as well as normalization of the graph, depicts significant accuracy between target and output values. The results reveal that machine learning proposed adamant accuracy and has elucidated performance in the prediction aspect.",

Sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide solutions are used as an alkaline activator. The results of the investigation show that the activator ratio plays an important role on the mechanical development of geopolymer pastes. The geopolymeric gel and CSH phase with a low Ca/Si ratio are found as the main reaction product. The increased intensity of CSH phase has a significant effect on the improvement of the compressive strength. Decreased intensity of clinoptilolite and totally consumed clay mineral upon geopolymerization proves the involvement of the aluminosilicate phases in the geopolymeric reaction. The existence of sodium and increment of Si/Al ratio with respect to original zeolitic tuff were detected. The results also show that the investigated natural zeolite, which is emerged as an environmentally friendly, low-cost material, is suitable for the production of geopolymer cement.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the influence of different fiber materials on the dynamic splitting mechanical properties of concrete was investigated. Brazil disc dynamic splitting tests were conducted on plain concrete, palm fiber-reinforced concrete, and steel fiber-reinforced concrete specimens using a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) test device with a 100 mm diameter and a V2512 high-speed digital camera. The Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique was used to analyze the fracture process and crack propagation behavior of different fiber-reinforced concrete specimens and obtain their dynamic tensile properties and energy dissipation. The experimental results indicate that the addition of fibers can enhance the impact toughness of concrete, reduce the occurrence of failure at the loading end of specimens due to stress concentration, delay the time to failure of specimens, and effectively suppress the expansion of cracks. Steel fibers exhibit a better crack-inhibiting effect on concrete compared to palm fibers. The incident energy for the three types of concrete specimens is roughly the same under the same impact pressure. Compared with plain concrete, the energy absorption rate of palm fiber concrete is decreased, while that of steel fiber concrete is increased. Palm fiber-reinforced concrete and steel fiber-reinforced concrete have lower peak strains than plain concrete under the same loading duration. The addition of steel fibers significantly impedes the internal cracking process of concrete specimens, resulting in a relatively slow growth of damage variables.",

        "abstract": "Chloride corrosion is a key factor affecting the life of marine concrete, and surface chloride concentration is the main parameter for analyzing its durability. In this paper, we first introduce six erosion mechanism models for surface chloride ion concentration, reveal the convection effect in the diffusion behavior of chloride ions, and then introduce the corrosion mechanisms that occur in different marine exposure environments. On this basis, the analysis is carried out using empirical formulations and machine learning methods, which provides a clearer understanding of the research characteristics and differences between empirical formulas and emerging machine learning techniques. This paper summarizes the time-varying model and multifactor coupling model on the basis of empirical analysis. It is found that the exponential function and the reciprocal function are more consistent with the distribution law of chloride ion concentration, the multifactor model containing the time-varying law is the most effective, and the Chen model is the most reliable. Machine learning, as an emerging method, has been widely used in concrete durability research. It can make up for the shortcomings of the empirical formula method and solve the multifactor coupling problem of surface chloride ion concentration with strong prediction ability. In addition, the difficulty of data acquisition is also a major problem that restricts the development of machine learning and incorporating concrete maintenance conditions into machine learning is a future development direction. Through this study, researchers can systematically understand the characteristics and differences of different research methods and their respective models and choose appropriate techniques to explore the durability of concrete structures. Moreover, intelligent computing will certainly occupy an increasingly important position in marine concrete research.",

In this experimental study, water to cement ratio remained unchanged, a control mixture without GNP materials and the addition of GNP was ranging from 0.02% to 0.4% by weight of ordinary Portland cement was prepared. Specimens were carried out by the rapid freeze-thaw test, according to the current Chinese standard. The workability, compressive strength, visual deterioration and mass loss of concrete samples were evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy also applied in order to investigate the micromorphology inside of the concrete. The results showed that GNP concrete has a finer pore structure than ordinary concrete; moreover, the workability of GNP concrete reduced, and the compressive strength of specimens was enhanced within the appropriate range of GNP addition; in addition, GNP concrete performed better than the control concrete in the durability of concrete exposed to F-T actions. Specimens with 0.05% GNP exhibited the highest compressive property after 200 F–T cycles compared with other samples.",

        "abstract": "The successful application of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) in mortar composites depends on their dispersion properties. In this study, MWCNTs and GNPs were modified by the surfactant polycarboxylate ether (PC). One-dimensional MWCNTs and two-dimensional GNPs led to the MWCNTs forming a bridge between adjacent GNP sheets, effectively avoiding restacking of GNPs and agglomeration of MWCNTs, which resulted in greater dispersion. An excellent synergetic effect was generated between MWCNTs and GNPs, enhancing various physical and chemical properties. Hybrid GNP/MWCNT structures improved the mechanical properties of mortar composites (compressive strength and tensile strength) and volume stability (drying shrinkage). Scanning electron microscope images clearly showed that hybrid GNPs/MWCNTs were compatible for use in mortar composites. The hybrid weight ratio of GN11-PC (GNPs:MWCNTs = 1 : 1) led to optimal compressive strength, greater than that obtained upon addition of GNPs or MWCNTs individually. The compressive strength of the mortar composites containing 0·05 wt% GN11-PC (by weight of cement) aged for 28 d increased by 61% in comparison with the blank sample, and the tensile strength increased by 47·1%, while shrinkage decreased by 6·9%.",

To comprehensively understand the pore structure of RPC composites with surface-modified CNTs and then control their properties, both the mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) technologies were used to characterize the pore structure characteristics of RPC composites. Experimental results showed there exist large number of nano-scale pores (mainly interlayer and gel pores) with the radius range of 0.3–20 nm in RPC composites. All types of surface-modified CNTs incorporated in this study reduce the pore content and size of RPC composites, thereby modifying the pore structure of RPC. However, different CNTs present varying effects on the pore (especially nano-scale pore) structure characteristics. Among all surface-modified CNTs, the hydroxyl functionalized and nickel-coated CNTs cause the structural shrinkage of C-S-H gel, while the carboxyl functionalized CNTs induce the transformation of some nano-scale pores inside the gel. The effects of surface-modified CNTs on the pore structure of RPC composites are mainly on the nano- and micrometer scale. CNTs can not only increase the matrix compactness of RPC composites and enhance the network structure of hydration products, but also induce the pore water conversion inside C-S-H layers.",

        "abstract": "With the utilisation of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) in building construction, the durability of this material requires particular attention, especially in terms of chloride penetration. This paper presents a numerical study on the chloride diffusion mechanism within RAC. Considering the random distribution of recycled coarse aggregates (RCA), a five-phase RAC model – including new mortar, adherent old mortar, new interfacial transition zone (ITZ), old ITZ and original natural coarse aggregates – is proposed to predict the effective diffusion coefficient of chlorides in RAC. The parametric studies, based on a series of critical factors (i.e. volume fraction of RCA, adhesive ratio of old mortar, chloride diffusivity of adherent old mortar, thicknesses of old and new ITZs and chloride diffusivity of old and new ITZs), reveal the properties of each phase and their individual impact on the effective diffusion coefficient of chlorides in RAC. The results obtained indicate that, interestingly, the effective diffusion coefficient tends to vary in terms of its relationships with high-quality adherent old mortar, lower adhesive ratio of old mortar, smaller thickness of ITZs and relatively superior chloride penetration resistance of ITZs, which cannot be found from existing models and experiments.",

An increase in the spinel concentration to 10 wt.% caused an avalanche-like rise in roughness due to the formation of nanoparticle agglomerates. The lateral mode of atomic force microscopy (AFM) allowed us to trace the agglomeration dynamics. An unexpected result was that the composite with 6 wt.% of filler had a low friction coefficient in comparison with similar composites due to the successfully combined effects of low roughness and surface energy. The friction coefficient decreased to 0.07 when the friction coefficient of pure PVA was 0.72. A specially developed method for measuring nano-objects’ surface energy using AFM made it possible to explain the anomalous nature of the change in tribological characteristics.",

        "abstract": "In the past decades, nanomaterials have become one of the focal points in civil engineering research. When added to cement-based construction materials (e.g., concrete), it results in significant improvements in their strength and other important properties. However, the final mix characteristics depend on many variables that must be taken into account. As such, there is no general consensus regarding the influence upon the original material of certain nano-sized additives, the optimum dosage or the synergistic effect of two or more nano-materials. This is also the case for titanium dioxide (TiO2) and nanoclay (NC). The paper focuses on reporting the existing research data on the use of the above-mentioned materials when added to mortar and concrete. The collected data is summarized and presented in terms of strength and durability properties of cement mortar and concrete containing either TiO2 or NC. Both nano-materials have been proven, by various studies, to increase the strength of the composite, at both room and elevated temperature, when added by themselves in 0.5%~12% for TiO2 and 0.25%~6% for NC. It can be inferred that a combination of the two with the cementitious matrix can be beneficial and may lead to obtaining a new material with improved strength, elastic and durability properties that can be applied in the construction industry, with implications at the economic, social and environmental levels.",

Thus, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review involving the uses of different nanomaterials for production of high-performance cementitious, geopolymer, and alkali-activated concrete composites. The effects of nanomaterials on the fresh properties, mechanical properties, and durability of diverse nanoparticle-modified concrete composites are analyzed. The past developments, recent trends, environmental impact, sustainability, notable benefits, and demerits of various nanomaterial-based concrete production are emphasized. It is demonstrated that nanomaterials including SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, and Fe2O3, etc., can be used effectively to enhance the microstructures and mechanical characteristics (such as compressive strength, flexural, and splitting tensile strengths) of the modified concrete composites, thus improving their anti-erosion, anti-chloride penetration, and other durability traits. In short, this communication may provide deep insight into the role of diverse nanoparticle inclusion in concrete composites to improve their overall attributes.",

Specifically, concrete in tidal areas is influenced by the joint action of Cl- erosion and carbonation, resulting in severe structural corrosion and reduced durability. In this study, nanoconcrete was alternately subject to immersion and carbonization in 5%NaCl to investigate the influence of nanoparticles on the durability of marine concrete under the combined action of Cl- erosion and carbonization. The free Cl- concentration and carbonization depth in concrete were considered as test indexes to evaluate the durability of nanoconcrete under their combined action. The concrete microstructure was analyzed via SEM and XRD. The results demonstrated that the use of nanoconcrete significantly reduced the carbonation depth for the same cycle number. The free Cl- concentration of nanoconcrete at 0–5 mm depth, 56 N cycles, and 2% and 1% nano-SiO2 and nano-ZnO content was 19.3% and 17.6% lower, respectively, than that of normal concrete. Microscopic tests revealed that nanoparticles could optimize the concrete pore structure, generate C-S-H gels, and make the internal structure of concrete dense. Consequently, the addition of nano-SiO2 and nano-ZnO to concrete can significantly improve its resistance against the joint action of Cl- erosion and carbonation, and effectively enhance the durability of marine concrete.",

In the present investigation, a number of experimental studies were conducted on slag-based geopolymer concrete. Accordingly, nano-silica particles were used to improve the geopolymer concrete structure's matrix. In the current study, slag-based geopolymer concrete was used with 0–2% polyolefin fibres and 0–8% nano-silica. They were subjected to water absorption and permeability tests to assess their durability. The addition of nano-silica enhanced the whole properties of the slag-based geopolymer concrete. By using the nano-silica, the concrete paste microstructure became denser and more homogeneous, and the pores decreased. The compressive strength and tensile strength of the concrete increased by up to 22% and 14% respectively. On the other hand, in terms of durability, the nano-silica lowered the water absorption and permeability coefficients by up to 24% and 44%, respectively, by filling the pores of the concrete. In the weight loss test, geopolymer concrete achieved superior results (up to 16%) compared to ordinary concrete.",

        "abstract": "Aspect-level sentiment analysis is a granular emotional classification task that refers to identifying sentiment polarities towards aspects in a sentence. Although previous research has reached a great achievement, this task remains very challenging. First, previous approaches only focus on one specific domain, which lacks the capability of transferring to other domains. Moreover, the majority of prior studies ignore the direct relationship between aspects and the corresponding sentiment words. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel model named Efficient Adaptive Transfer Network (EATN) for aspect-level sentiment analysis which emphasizes the need of incorporating the correlation among multiple domains. The proposed EATN provides a Domain Adaptation Module (DAM) to learn common features from the sufficiently labeled source domain and to guide the classification performance in the target domain. Specifically, DAM comprises two special tasks, with one sentiment classification task aiming to learn sentiment knowledge and the other domain classification task focusing on learning domain-invariant features. Moreover, we design aspect-aware multi-head attention mechanism to capture the direct associations between the aspects and the contextual sentiment words, which is beneficial to learn the aspect-aware semantic knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our method.",

        "abstract": "Several types of amorphous silica generate pozzolanic reactions at micro- and nano-scale, which can improve concrete macro-structural characteristic. However, their addition can raise the viscosity of the mixture, thus decreasing its workability. In the present work is proposed an experimental setup to determine concrete compression and manageability performance adding Silica Fume (SF), 0.0, 6.5, 8.5, 10.0% w/b, colloidal silica (nSi), 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5% w/b and SF-nSi combined, 0.0-0.0, 0.2-8.5, 0.2-10% w/b, and an extensive overview of the literature for concrete mixtures with SF, nSi and SF-nSi combined. The results show that the addition of SF can increase compressive strength by 12%, nevertheless, can also lead to decreases in manageability of the sample (e.g., a decrease by 67% for a dosage of 10.0% w/b). On the other hand, nSi can increase compressive strength by up to 25% with a dosage of 2.5% and can increase the manageability by 78% for dosages greater than 0.5% w/b. When combining the two materials, an increase in compressive strength was observed, along with a loss of workability. A statistical analysis of the data found in literature is proposed, highlighting interesting trends of behavior between SF and nSi with workability and compressive strength, as well as a lack of research for slump outcomes and for the effects of combined additives in concrete.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to provide guidelines for selecting the correct type of carbon nanotube (CNT) to improve the mechanical properties of cementitious materials. Previous researchers have discussed the effect of CNT characteristics on their dispersion quality. However, the effect of these characteristics on the mechanical properties of CNT-reinforced cementitious materials is not fully understood. To clarify this, the study reported in this paper was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, a database was established from the literature to study the influences of three different parameters associated with CNTs (length, diameter and concentration based on the weight percent of cement powder (c-wt%)) on compressive and flexural strengths. The analyses revealed that short and small-diameter CNTs could be beneficial for increasing compressive strength. Conversely, relatively long and large-diameter CNTs were more effective in increasing flexural strength. In general, an average CNT length of 10–20 μm and an average diameter of 20–32·5 nm resulted in the highest overall mechanical performance. The optimal upper limit concentrations for flexural and compressive strengths were found to be 0·15 and 0·20 c-wt%, respectively. In the second phase of this study, the statistical analyses were experimentally verified using the CNT optimum length, two diameters and three levels of concentrations.",

In this paper, we briefly introduce the influence of nano-SiO 2 on setting time, slump, shrinkage, durability and mechanical properties of concrete. In addition, this review also includes the microstructure measured by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the content of various hydration products obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The result shows that the setting time of nano-SiO 2 concrete is shortened, the slump is reduced and the shrinkage is improved owing to the high activity and nucleation of nano-SiO 2 . The improvement effect of nano-SiO 2 on concrete is remarkable, especially in the aspect of enhancing the durability of concrete. It should be noted that nano-SiO 2 shows limited improvement in the mechanical properties of concrete. In the end, this literature summary explains the macro performance of nano-silica modified concrete through microstructure.",

        "abstract": "In the past decades, nanomaterials have become one of the focal points in civil engineering research. When added to cement-based construction materials (e.g., concrete), it results in significant improvements in their strength and other important properties. However, the final mix characteristics depend on many variables that must be taken into account. As such, there is no general consensus regarding the influence upon the original material of certain nano-sized additives, the optimum dosage or the synergistic effect of two or more nano-materials. This is also the case for titanium dioxide (TiO2) and nanoclay (NC). The paper focuses on reporting the existing research data on the use of the above-mentioned materials when added to mortar and concrete. The collected data is summarized and presented in terms of strength and durability properties of cement mortar and concrete containing either TiO2 or NC. Both nano-materials have been proven, by various studies, to increase the strength of the composite, at both room and elevated temperature, when added by themselves in 0.5%~12% for TiO2 and 0.25%~6% for NC. It can be inferred that a combination of the two with the cementitious matrix can be beneficial and may lead to obtaining a new material with improved strength, elastic and durability properties that can be applied in the construction industry, with implications at the economic, social and environmental levels.",

        "abstract": "This article deals with the study of hazardous chromium leaching, stabilized/solidified by cement CEM II after 28 days of curing, in an acidic environment. The mortars subjected to this study were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization to evaluate the influence of chromium waste on their mineralogical structure. In the study range (0.6–1.2%), increasing the mass percentage of Cr2O3 in the mortars indicates that chromium accelerates the hydration process and setting of the mortar and increases the mechanical strength of the mortars compared to the control sample. It was observed that the release of chromium during the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test and the efficiency of the stabilization/solidification process depended on the initial Cr concentration and the leaching time. The use of XRD allowed the identification of new crystallized phases in the cement matrices, namely, CaCrO4·2H2O and chromium–ettringite Ca6Cr2(SO4)3(OH)12·26H2O, which confirms the immobilization of chromium and the efficiency of the stabilization/solidification process. In this research, the release mechanism was found to be primarily a surface phenomenon by modeling the experimental data (dissolution or precipitation).",

        "abstract": "Abstract In this study, zirconium oxide nanofiber with a mean diameter of 100 nm was added to concrete at various concentrations as a cement replacement. Various tests, including compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, flexural strength, and electrical resistance tests, as well as a rapid chloride penetration test, were performed on specimens containing zirconium oxide nanofibers for the concrete assessment, and the results were compared to those obtained from control specimens that did not contain nanofibers. The results showed that adding zirconium oxide nanofibers at 135 gr/m 3 of concrete yielded a 28-day compressive strength equal to 44.62 MPa, which exhibits a 20.40% increase in strength with respect to the specimen that lacked nanofibers. The flexural strength and splitting tensile strength tests at 28 days of age and in the presence of 135 gr/m 3 mentioned nanofibers were increased by 22.28 and 33.47%, respectively, in comparison to the control specimens. Moreover, revealed that at 28 days of age, in the specimens containing 270 gr/m 3 zirconium oxide nanofibers, the migration coefficient of chloride ion was reduced by 29.86%, and its electrical resistance was increased by 68.33%. These findings highlight the potential of nanofibers as a promising solution for enhancing the strength and performance of concrete structures.",

        "abstract": "The cementitious composites have different properties in the changing environment. Thus, knowing their mechanical properties is very important for safety reasons. The most important in the case of concrete is the Compressive strength (CS). To predict the CS of concrete Machine learning (ML) approaches has been essential. This study includes the collection of data from the experimental work and the application of ML techniques to predict the CS of concrete containing fly ash. The chemical and physical properties of all the materials used in this study were evaluated. Although, the emphasis of this research is on the use of supervised machine learning algorithms to forecast the CS of concrete. The Gene expression programming (GEP), Artificial neural network (ANN), and Decision tree (DT) algorithms were investigated for the prediction of outcome (CS). Concrete samples (cylinders) with different mix ratios were cast and tested at various ages to maintain the required data for applying it to run the models. Total 98 data points were collected from the experimental approach, in which seven parameters namely cement, fly ash, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, water, and days were taken as input to predict the output which was CS parameter. The experimental data is further validated by mean of k-fold cross-validation using R2, root mean error (RME), and Root mean square error (RMSE). In addition, statistical checks were incorporated to evaluate the model performance. In comparison, the bagging algorithm shows high accuracy towards the prediction of outcome as indicated by its high coefficient correlation (R2) value equals to 0.95, while R2 value for GEP, ANN and DT comes to 0.86, 0.81 and 0.75 respectively.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a comparative analysis of individual and ensemble learning algorithms (ELAs) to predict the compressive strength (CS) and flexural strength (FS) of plastic concrete. Multilayer perceptron neuron network (MLPNN), Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and decision tree (DT) were used as base learners, which were then combined with bagging and Adaboost methods to improve the predictive performance. In addition, gene expression programming (GEP) was used to develop computational equations that can be used to predict the CS and FS of plastic concrete. An extensive database containing 357 and 125 data points was obtained from the literature, and the eight most impactful ingredients were used in the model’s development. The accuracy of all models was assessed using several statistical measures, including an error matrix, Akaike information criterion (AIC), K-fold cross-validation, and other external validation equations. Furthermore, sensitivity and SHAP analysis were performed to evaluate input variables' relative significance and impact on the anticipated CS and FS. Based on statistical measures and other validation criteria, GEP outpaces all other individual models, whereas, in ELAs, the SVR ensemble with Adaboost and RF modified with the Bagging technique demonstrated superior performance. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and sensitivity analysis reveal that plastic, cement, water, and the age of the specimens have the highest influence, while superplasticizer has the lowest impact, which is consistent with experimental studies. Moreover, GUI and GEP-based simple mathematical correlation can enhance the practical scope of this study and be an effective tool for the pre-mix design of plastic concrete.",

        "abstract": "Silica fume (SF) is a mineral additive that is widely used in the construction industry when producing sustainable concrete. The integration of SF in concrete as a partial replacement for cement has several evident benefits, including reduced CO2 emissions, cost-effective concrete, increased durability, and mechanical qualities. As environmental issues continue to grow, the development of predictive machine learning models is critical. Thus, this study aims to create modelling tools for estimating the compressive and cracking tensile strengths of silica fume concrete. Multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLPNN), adaptive neural fuzzy detection systems (ANFIS), and genetic programming are all used (GEP). From accessible literature data, a broad and accurate database of 283 compressive strengths and 149 split tensile strengths was created. The six most significant input parameters were cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, water, superplasticizer, and silica fume. Different statistical measures were used to evaluate models, including mean absolute error, root mean square error, root mean squared log error and the coefficient of determination. Both machine learning models, MLPNN and ANFIS, produced acceptable results with high prediction accuracy. Statistical analysis revealed that the ANFIS model outperformed the MLPNN model in terms of compressive and tensile strength prediction. The GEP models outperformed all other models. The predicted values for compressive strength and splitting tensile strength for GEP models were consistent with experimental values, with an R2 value of 0.97 for compressive strength and 0.93 for splitting tensile strength. Furthermore, sensitivity tests revealed that cement and water are the determining parameters in the growth of compressive strength but have the least effect on splitting tensile strength. Cross-validation was used to avoid overfitting and to confirm the output of the generalized modelling technique. GEP develops an empirical expression for each outcome to forecast future databases’ features to promote the usage of green concrete.",

Model performance is evaluated by various statistical indicators like mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE). Individual algorithms show a moderate bias result. However, the ensemble model gives a better result with R2 = 0.911 compared to the decision tree (DT) and gene expression programming (GEP).

To study the complex nature of aerated concrete, a reliable and robust prediction model is required, employing different machine learning (ML) techniques. This study aims to predict the compressive strength of LFC by using a support vector machine (SVM) as an individual learner along with bagging, boosting, and random forest (RF) as a modified ensemble learner. For that purpose, a database of 191 data points was collected from published literature, where the mix design ingredients, i.e., cement content, sand content, water to cement ratio, and foam volume, were chosen to predict the compressive strength of LFC. The 10-K fold cross-validation method and different statistical error and regression tools, i.e., mean absolute error (MAE), root means square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determinant (R2), were used to evaluate the performance of the developed ML models. The modified ensemble learner (RF) outperforms all models by yielding a strong correlation of R2 = 0.96 along with the lowest statistical error values of MAE = 1.84 MPa and RMSE = 2.52 MPa. Overall, the result suggests that the ensemble learners would significantly enhance the performance and robustness of ML models.",

This corrosion severely affects the performance of the elements and may shorten the lifespan of an entire structure. Even though experimental activities in laboratories might be a solution, they may also be problematic due to time and costs. Thus, the application of individual machine learning (ML) techniques has been investigated to predict surface chloride concentrations (Cc) in marine structures. For this purpose, the values of Cc in tidal, splash, and submerged zones were collected from an extensive literature survey and incorporated into the article. Gene expression programming (GEP), the decision tree (DT), and an artificial neural network (ANN) were used to predict the surface chloride concentrations, and the most accurate algorithm was then selected. The GEP model was the most accurate when compared to ANN and DT, which was confirmed by the high accuracy level of the K-fold cross-validation and linear correlation coefficient (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) parameters. As is shown in the article, the proposed method is an effective and accurate way to predict the surface chloride concentration without the inconveniences of laboratory tests.",

        "abstract": "The complication linked with the prediction of the ultimate capacity of concrete-filled steel tubes (CFST) short circular columns reveals a need for conducting an in-depth structural behavioral analyses of this member subjected to axial-load only. The distinguishing feature of gene expression programming (GEP) has been utilized for establishing a prediction model for the axial behavior of long CFST. The proposed equation correlates the ultimate axial capacity of long circular CFST with depth, thickness, yield strength of steel, the compressive strength of concrete and the length of the CFST, without need for conducting any expensive and laborious experiments. A comprehensive CFST short circular column under an axial load was obtained from extensive literature to build the proposed models, and subsequently implemented for verification purposes. This model consists of extensive database literature and is comprised of 227 data samples. External validations were carried out using several statistical criteria recommended by researchers. The developed GEP model demonstrated superior performance to the available design methods for AS5100.6, EC4, AISC, BS, DBJ and AIJ design codes. The proposed design equations can be reliably used for pre-design purposes—or may be used as a fast check for deterministic solutions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The development of nanotechnology has led to the creation of materials with unique properties, and in recent years, numerous attempts have been made to include nanoparticles in concrete in an effort to increase its performance and create concrete with improved qualities. Nanomaterials are typically added to lightweight concrete (LWC) with the goal of improving the composite’s mechanical, microstructure, freshness, and durability qualities. Compressive strength is the most crucial mechanical characteristic for all varieties of concrete composites. For this reason, it is essential to create accurate models for estimating the compressive strength (CS) of LWC to save time, energy, and money. In addition, it provides useful information for planning the construction schedule and indicates when the formwork should be removed. To predict the CS of LWC mixtures made with or without nanomaterials, nine different models were proposed in this study: the gradient-boosted trees (GBT), random forest, tree ensemble, XGBoosted (XGB), Keras, simple regression, probabilistic neural networks, multilayer perceptron, and linear relationship model. A total of 2,568 samples were gathered and examined. The most significant factors influencing CS during the modeling process were taken into account as input variables, including the amount of nanomaterials, cement, water-to-binder ratio, density, the content of lightweight aggregates, type of nano, fine and coarse aggregate content, and water. The performance of the suggested models was assessed using a variety of statistical measures, including the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ), scatter index, mean absolute error, and root-mean-squared error (RMSE). The findings showed that, in comparison to other models, the GBT model outperformed the others in predicting the compression strength of LWC mixtures enhanced with nanomaterials. The GBT model produced the best results, with the greatest value of R 2 (0.9) and the lowest value of RMSE (5.286). Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis showed that the most important factor influencing the prediction of the CS of LWC enhanced with nanoparticles is the water content.",

We then ranked the features based on t-test. The Cluster Prominence is selected as target node. The association and arc analysis were determined based on mutual information. The occurrence and reliability of selected cluster states were computed. The Cluster Prominence at state ≤330.85 yielded ROC index of 100%, relative Gini index of 99.98%, and relative Gini index of 100%.

        "abstract": "Predicting evaporation is essential for managing water resources in basins. Improvement of the prediction accuracy is essential to identify adequate inputs on evaporation. In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) is coupled with several evolutionary algorithms, i.e., capuchin search algorithm (CSA), firefly algorithm (FFA), sine cosine algorithm (SCA), and genetic algorithm (GA) for robust training to predict daily evaporation of seven synoptic stations with different climates. The inclusive multiple model (IMM) is then used to predict evaporation based on established hybrid ANN models. The adjusting model parameters of the current study is a major challenge. Also, another challenge is the selection of the best inputs to the models. The IMM model had significantly improved the root mean square error (RMSE) and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of all the proposed models. The results for all stations indicated that the IMM model and ANN-CSA could outperform other models. The RMSE of the IMM was 18, 21, 22, 30, and 43% lower than those of the ANN-CSA, ANN-SCA, ANN-FFA, ANN-GA, and ANN models in the Sharekord station. The MAE of the IMM was 0.112 mm/day, while it was 0.189 mm/day, 0.267 mm/day, 0.267 mm/day, 0.389 mm/day, 0.456 mm/day, and 0.512 mm/day for the ANN-CSA, ANN-SCA, and ANN-FFA, ANN-GA, and ANN models, respectively, in the Tehran station. The current study proved that the inclusive multiple models based on improved ANN models considering the fuzzy reasoning had the high ability to predict evaporation.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid growth of Internet data traffic, the means of malicious attack become more diversified. The single modal intrusion detection model cannot fully exploit the rich feature information in the massive network traffic data, resulting in unsatisfactory detection results. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multimodal hybrid parallel network intrusion detection model (MHPN). The proposed model extracts network traffic features from two modalities: the statistical information of network traffic and the original load of traffic, and constructs appropriate neural network models for each modal information. Firstly, a two-branch convolutional neural network is combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to extract the spatio-temporal feature information of network traffic from the original load mode of traffic, and a convolutional neural network is used to extract the feature information of traffic statistics. Then, the feature information extracted from the two modalities is fused and fed to the CosMargin classifier for network traffic classification. The experimental results on the ISCX-IDS 2012 and CIC-IDS-2017 datasets show that the MHPN model outperforms the single-modal models and achieves an average accuracy of 99.98 $ \\% $ . The model also demonstrates strong robustness and a positive sample recognition rate.",

In this paper, a new type-2 fuzzy control (T2FLC) approach is presented for load frequency control (LFC) in power systems with multi-areas, demand response (DR), battery energy storage system (BESS), and wind farms. BESS is used to reduce the frequency deviations caused by wind energy, and DR is utilized to increase network stability due to fast load changes. The suggested T2FLC is online tuned based on the extended Kalman filter to improve the LFC accuracy in coordination of DR, BESS, and wind farms. The system dynamics are unknown, and the system Jacobian is extracted by online modeling with a simple multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN). The designed LFC is evaluated through simulating on 10-machine New England 39-bus test system (NETS-39b) in four scenarios. Simulation results verifies the desired performance, indicating its superiority compared to a classical PI controllers, and type-1 fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs). The mean of improvement percentage is about 20%.",

The distinguishing feature of gene expression programming (GEP) has been utilized for establishing a prediction model for the axial behavior of long CFST. The proposed equation correlates the ultimate axial capacity of long circular CFST with depth, thickness, yield strength of steel, the compressive strength of concrete and the length of the CFST, without need for conducting any expensive and laborious experiments. A comprehensive CFST short circular column under an axial load was obtained from extensive literature to build the proposed models, and subsequently implemented for verification purposes. This model consists of extensive database literature and is comprised of 227 data samples. External validations were carried out using several statistical criteria recommended by researchers. The developed GEP model demonstrated superior performance to the available design methods for AS5100.6, EC4, AISC, BS, DBJ and AIJ design codes. The proposed design equations can be reliably used for pre-design purposes—or may be used as a fast check for deterministic solutions.",

The statistical error checks and criteria suggested in the literature are considered for the verification of the predictive strength of the models. The statistical measures considered in this study are MAE, RSE, RMSE, RRMSE, R, and performance index <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"minf3\"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math> . These checks verify that the ANFIS predictive model gives an outstanding performance followed by GEP and ANN predictive models. In the validation stage, the coefficient of correlation (R) for ANFIS, GEP, and ANN model is 0.9783, 0.9643, and 0.9314, respectively. All three models also fulfill the external verification criterion suggested in the literature. Generally, the GEP predictive model is ideal as it delivers a simplistic and easy mathematical equation for future use. The k-fold cross-validation (CV) of the GEP model is also conducted, which verifies the robustness of the GEP predictive model. Furthermore, the parametric study is carried via proposed GEP expression. This confirms that the GEP model accurately covers the influence of all the explanatory variables used for the prediction of <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"minf4\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math> of FGPC.

        "abstract": "Due to the advantages of all-weather capability and high resolution, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image ship detection has been widely applied in the military, civilian, and other domains. However, SAR-based ship detection suffers from limitations such as strong scattering of targets, multiple scales, and background interference, leading to low detection accuracy. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel SAR ship detection method, NAS-YOLOX, which leverages the efficient feature fusion of the neural architecture search feature pyramid network (NAS-FPN) and the effective feature extraction of the multi-scale attention mechanism. Specifically, NAS-FPN replaces the PAFPN in the baseline YOLOX, greatly enhances the fusion performance of the model’s multi-scale feature information, and a dilated convolution feature enhancement module (DFEM) is designed and integrated into the backbone network to improve the network’s receptive field and target information extraction capabilities. Furthermore, a multi-scale channel-spatial attention (MCSA) mechanism is conceptualised to enhance focus on target regions, improve small-scale target detection, and adapt to multi-scale targets. Additionally, extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, HRSID and SSDD, demonstrate that NAS-YOLOX achieves comparable or superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art ship detection models and reaches best accuracies of 91.1% and 97.2% on AP0.5, respectively.",

Firstly, the creep data in Northwestern University (NU) database is preprocessed by a prebuilt XGBoost model and then split into a training set and a testing set. Then, by Bayesian Optimization and 5-fold cross validation, the 3 EML models are tuned to achieve high accuracy (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.953, 0.947 and 0.946 for LGBM, XGBoost and RF, respectively). In the testing set, the EML models show significantly higher accuracy than the equation proposed by the fib Model Code 2010 (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.377). Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), based on the cooperative game theories, are calculated to interpretate the predictions of the EML model. Five most influential parameters for concrete creep compliance are identified by the SHAP values of EML models as follows: time since loading, compressive strength, age when loads are applied, relative humidity during the test and temperature during the test. The patterns captured by the three EML models are consistent with theoretical understanding of factors that influence concrete creep, which proves that the proposed EML models show reasonable predictions.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "This study considered and predicted blast-induced ground vibration (PPV) in open-pit mines using bagging and sibling techniques under the rigorous combination of machine learning algorithms. Accordingly, four machine learning algorithms, including support vector regression (SVR), extra trees (ExTree), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision tree regression (DTR), were used as the base models for the purposes of combination and PPV initial prediction. The bagging regressor (BA) was then applied to combine these base models with the efforts of variance reduction, overfitting elimination, and generating more robust predictive models, abbreviated as BA-ExTree, BAKNN, BA-SVR, and BA-DTR. It is emphasized that the ExTree model has not been considered for predicting blastinduced ground vibration before, and the bagging of ExTree is an innovation aiming to improve the accuracy of the inherently ExTree model, as well. In addition, two empirical models (i.e., USBM and Ambraseys) were also treated and compared with the bagging models to gain a comprehensive assessment. With this aim, we collected 300 blasting events with different parameters at the Sin Quyen copper mine (Vietnam), and the produced PPV values were also measured. They were then compiled as the dataset to develop the PPV predictive models. The results revealed that the bagging models provided better performance than the empirical models, except for the BA-DTR model. Of those, the BA-ExTree is the best model with the highest accuracy (i.e., 88.8%). Whereas, the empirical models only provided the accuracy from 73.6%–76%. The details of comparisons and assessments were also presented in this study.",

To predict the compressive strength of concrete six input parameters that are cement, water, silica fume, super plasticizer, fine aggregate and coarse aggregate are identified. A total of 639 different data sets of concrete was collected from the technical literature. Training data sets comprises 400 data entries, and the remaining data entries (239) are divided between the validation and testing sets. Different combinations of layers, number of neurons, activation functions, different values for learning rate and momentum were considered and the results were validated using an independent validation data set. A detailed study was carried out, considering two hidden layers for the architecture of neural network. The performance of the 6-12-6-1 architecture was the best possible architecture. The MSE for the training set was 5.33% for the 400 training data points, 6.13% for the 100 verification data points and 6.02 % for the 139 testing data points. The results of the present investigation indicate that ANNs have strong potential as a feasible tool for predicting the compressive strength of concrete.",

        "abstract": "The electrically conductive cementitious composite (ECCC) offers plenty of advantages such as high conductivity and strain sensitivity. The ECCC can also act as a conductive sensor in a cathodic protection system for structural health monitoring. Before the ECCC application, it is essential to understand and predict the uniaxial compressive stress (UCS) and electrical resistivity. In this study, we produced ECCC with three conductive fillers: graphite powder (GP), waste steel slag (SS) as well as ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS). By changing the content levels of the three conductive fillers, cement and curing ages, we prepared 81 mixture proportions for UCS test and 108 mixture proportions for resistivity test. The results show that although GP improves the conductivity more significantly than the other conductive fillers but it simultaneously has a higher negative influence on UCS. Meanwhile, slag solids (GGBS and SS) enhance the conductive performance but reduce UCS after their replacement ratio is larger than 20%. Compared with GGBS, ECCC containing SS has higher UCS and conductivity. Besides, we proposed a random forest (RF) based machine learning model to predict the UCS and resistivity. The hyperparameters of the RF model were tuned by the beetle antennae search (BAS) algorithm. This hybrid BAS-RF model has high prediction accuracy, as indicated by high correlation coefficients on test sets (0.986 for UCS and 0.98 for resistivity, respectively). We simulated the influence of different conductive fillers on UCS and conductivity using the developed BAS-RF model. The simulation results agree well with the results obtained by laboratory experiments. This study offers a new idea to use waste slags to produce ECCC and paves the way to intelligent construction.",

        "abstract": "Compressive and flexural strength are the crucial properties of a material. The strength of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) is comparatively lower than that of natural aggregate concrete. Several factors, including the recycled aggregate replacement ratio, parent concrete strength, water–cement ratio, water absorption, density of the recycled aggregate, etc., affect the RAC’s strength. Several studies have been performed to study the impact of these factors individually. However, it is challenging to examine their combined impact on the strength of RAC through experimental investigations. Experimental studies involve casting, curing, and testing samples, for which substantial effort, price, and time are needed. For rapid and cost-effective research, it is critical to apply new methods to the stated purpose. In this research, the compressive and flexural strengths of RAC were predicted using ensemble machine learning methods, including gradient boosting and random forest. Twelve input factors were used in the dataset, and their influence on the strength of RAC was analyzed. The models were validated and compared using correlation coefficients (R2), variance between predicted and experimental results, statistical tests, and k-fold analysis. The random forest approach outperformed gradient boosting in anticipating the strength of RAC, with an R2 of 0.91 and 0.86 for compressive and flexural strength, respectively. The models’ decreased error values, such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE), confirmed the higher precision of the random forest models. The MAE values for the random forest models were 4.19 MPa and 0.56 MPa, whereas the MAE values for the gradient boosting models were 4.78 MPa and 0.64 MPa, for compressive and flexural strengths, respectively. Machine learning technologies will benefit the construction sector by facilitating the evaluation of material properties in a quick and cost-effective manner.",

        "abstract": "Silica fume (SF) is a frequently used mineral admixture in producing sustainable concrete in the construction sector. Incorporating SF as a partial substitution of cement in concrete has obvious advantages, including reduced CO2 emission, cost-effective concrete, enhanced durability, and mechanical properties. Due to ever-increasing environmental concerns, the development of predictive machine learning (ML) models requires time. Therefore, the present study focuses on developing modeling techniques in predicting the compressive strength of silica fume concrete. The employed techniques include decision tree (DT) and support vector machine (SVM). An extensive and reliable database of 283 compressive strengths was established from the available literature information. The six most influential factors, i.e., cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, water, superplasticizer, and silica fume, were considered as significant input parameters. The evaluation of models was performed by different statistical parameters, such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), root mean squared log error (RMSLE), and coefficient of determination (R2). Individual and ensemble models of DT and SVM showed satisfactory results with high prediction accuracy. Statistical analyses indicated that DT models bested SVM for predicting compressive strength. Ensemble modeling showed an enhancement of 11 percent and 1.5 percent for DT and SVM compressive strength models, respectively, as depicted by statistical parameters. Moreover, sensitivity analyses showed that cement and water are the governing parameters in developing compressive strength. A cross-validation technique was used to avoid overfitting issues and confirm the generalized modeling output. ML algorithms are used to predict SFC compressive strength to promote the use of green concrete.",

        "abstract": "The freeze-thaw (F-T) properties of ordinary concrete have been extensively studied and related models were well-established. However, these models cannot be used to accurately assess the F-T damage of dune sand and fiber reinforced concrete (DSFC), which is essential for performing targeted repairs. This study established an interpretable machine learning (ML) model to predict the F-T damage indicator D of DSFC through systematic comparisons of eight ML models (four classical models and four ensemble models). As an initial step, a dataset containing 257 samples was created by combining the F-T test results of this study and previous literature. This dataset was utilized to establish the eight models, which were then benchmarked against the polynomial models to select the optimal model. Subsequently, the selected model was interpreted using importance analysis, which included permutation feature importance (PFI) and partial dependency plots (PDP), to dissect the predictive mechanism of this model. Comparisons of eight models revealed that the four ensemble learning models generally outperforms the four classical learning models. Among the four ensemble learning models, XGBoost was verified to have optimal performance, with an R2 of 0.965 and RMSE of 0.019 on the test set. The importance analysis of XGBoost further demonstrated the inhibitory effect of dune sand and basalt fiber on F-T damage revealed in the experimental results. In summary, the proposed XGBoost along with importance analysis, is a practical methodology to predict and interpret the F-T damage of DSFC.",

To interpret the models and their predictions, we employed Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and partial dependency plots (PDP). All models showed good accuracy in predicting the fundamental period (T). The post-hoc explanations provided insights into (a) the importance of each feature, (b) their interaction, and (c) the underlying reasoning behind the predictions. For the first time, we have created a graphical interface that can predict the value of T along with its SHAP explanation. This interface can be useful in manually optimizing the design of reinforced concrete frame structures with masonry infill walls. However, the local explanations from SHAP and LIME exhibited significant discrepancies, and LIME underestimated the feature importance of dominant features compared to SHAP. These discrepancies observed in the explanations highlight the need for further research in the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in structural engineering.",

The minimum surface tension (γCMC) and critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the PFPE-C aqueous solution were 17.35 mN/m and 0.024 mmol/L, respectively. This study confirms that surfactants containing hydroxyethyl groups efficiently reduce the surface tension of aqueous solutions, and fluorocarbon surfactants exhibit better surface activity than ordinary hydrocarbon surfactants with similar structures. The micellization, aggregation, air-water interfacial adsorption, and wettability of PFPE-C aqueous solutions have been systematically investigated. Highly concentrated PFPE-C aqueous solutions exhibit good wettability on PTFE and paraffin films. Moreover, the aggregates of PFPE-C in the aqueous solution were clearly seen as vesicles on Cryo-TEM micrographs. Primary biodegradation results indicate that 19% of PFPC-C can be degraded within one week.",

As a result, this paper proposes three different neural network model comparisons for indoor location based on WiFi fingerprint - indoor location algorithm based on improved back propagation neural network model, RSSI indoor location algorithm based on neural network angle change, and RSSI indoor location algorithm based on depth neural network angle change - to raise accurately predict indoor location coordinates. Changing the action range of the activation function in the standard back-propagation neural network model achieves the goal of accurately predicting location coordinates. The revised back-propagation neural network model has strong stability and enhances indoor positioning accuracy based on experimental comparisons of loss rate (loss), accuracy rate (acc), and cumulative distribution function (CDF).",

        "abstract": "Energy prediction models are used in buildings as a performance evaluation engine in advanced control and optimisation, and in making informed decisions by facility managers and utilities for enhanced energy efficiency. Simplified and data-driven models are often the preferred option where pertinent information for detailed simulation are not available and where fast responses are required. We compared the performance of the widely-used feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) with random forest (RF), an ensemble-based method gaining popularity in prediction –&#13;\\nfor predicting the hourly HVAC energy consumption of a hotel in Madrid, Spain. Incorporating social parameters such as the numbers of guests marginally increased prediction accuracy in both cases. Overall, ANN performed marginally better than RF with root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 4.97 and 6.10 respectively. However, the ease of tuning and modelling with categorical variables offers ensemble-based algorithms an advantage for dealing with multi-dimensional complex data, typical in buildings. RF performs internal cross-validation (i.e. using out-of-bag samples) and only has a few tuning parameters. Both models have comparable predictive power and nearly equally applicable in building energy applications.",

This study aims to address the fundamental challenges of inadequate foot tracking and weak leg compliance control in multilegged robot motions. The first section summarizes and discusses the feasibility and operability of smooth motion for multilegged robots based on the necessary conditions and application value of walking over complicated and unstructured terrain. The second to fourth sections present a qualitative research method of literature review to study the effects of several factors on the smooth motion of multilegged robots, including foot force perception and motion planning, active compliance control, gait stability, and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) control. We conducted a case analysis of multilegged robots using traditional Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), biomimetic Central Pattern Generator (CPG), and DRL control in the latest international open-source projects to help readers further follow the latest open-source algorithms for legged robot motion control. In addition, we analyze the challenges these influencing factors face in optimization and provide suggestions for effectively promoting the realization of review objectives. In the fifth section, we discuss the challenges of springy gait and intelligent switching control in solving the problems of poor foot tracking and weak leg compliance. We explore and forecast the potential application of the Probability Density Function (PDF) control of the foot force in the smooth motion of multilegged robots. In the sixth section, we systematically discuss, analyze, and summarize the existing problems in this research field. We also highlight the shortcomings of existing research methods, look forward to future research areas, and highlight the obstacles that need to be overcome to promote future research in this field.",

        "abstract": "Background Extreme wildfires pose a serious threat to forest vegetation and human life because they spread more rapidly and are more intense than conventional wildfires. Detecting extreme wildfires is challenging due to their visual similarities to traditional fires, and existing models primarily detect the presence or absence of fires without focusing on distinguishing extreme wildfires and providing warnings. Aims To test a system for real time detection of four extreme wildfires. Methods We proposed a novel lightweight model, called LEF-YOLO, based on the YOLOv5 framework. To make the model lightweight, we introduce the bottleneck structure of MobileNetv3 and use depthwise separable convolution instead of conventional convolution. To improve the model’s detection accuracy, we apply a multiscale feature fusion strategy and use a Coordinate Attention and Spatial Pyramid Pooling-Fast block to enhance feature extraction. Key results The LEF-YOLO model outperformed the comparison model on the extreme wildfire dataset we constructed, with our model having excellent performance of 2.7 GFLOPs, 61 FPS and 87.9% mAP. Conclusions The detection speed and accuracy of LEF-YOLO can be utilised for the real-time detection of four extreme wildfires in forest fire scenes. Implications The system can facilitate fire control decision-making and foster the intersection between fire science and computer science.",

        "abstract": "Predicting pillar stability is a vital task in hard rock mines as pillar instability can cause large-scale collapse hazards. However, it is challenging because the pillar stability is affected by many factors. With the accumulation of pillar stability cases, machine learning (ML) has shown great potential to predict pillar stability. This study aims to predict hard rock pillar stability using gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) algorithms. First, 236 cases with five indicators were collected from seven hard rock mines. Afterwards, the hyperparameters of each model were tuned using a five-fold cross validation (CV) approach. Based on the optimal hyperparameters configuration, prediction models were constructed using training set (70% of the data). Finally, the test set (30% of the data) was adopted to evaluate the performance of each model. The precision, recall, and F1 indexes were utilized to analyze prediction results of each level, and the accuracy and their macro average values were used to assess the overall prediction performance. Based on the sensitivity analysis of indicators, the relative importance of each indicator was obtained. In addition, the safety factor approach and other ML algorithms were adopted as comparisons. The results showed that GBDT, XGBoost, and LightGBM algorithms achieved a better comprehensive performance, and their prediction accuracies were 0.8310, 0.8310, and 0.8169, respectively. The average pillar stress and ratio of pillar width to pillar height had the most important influences on prediction results. The proposed methodology can provide a reliable reference for pillar design and stability risk management.",

Recently, electroencephalography- (EEG-) based physiological and brain activities for fatigue detection have been increasingly investigated. However, how to find an effective method or model to timely and efficiently detect the mental states of drivers still remains a challenge. In this paper, we combine common spatial pattern (CSP) and propose a light-weighted classifier, LightFD, which is based on gradient boosting framework for EEG mental states identification. The comparable results with traditional classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural network (CNN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN), show that the proposed model could achieve better classification performance, as well as the decision efficiency. Furthermore, we also test and validate that LightFD has better transfer learning performance in EEG classification of driver mental states. In summary, our proposed LightFD classifier has better performance in real-time EEG mental state prediction, and it is expected to have broad application prospects in practical brain-computer interaction (BCI).",

Particularly, the limited displacement of small-to-moderate earthquakes (Mw<6.5) can easily be obscured by phase errors and/or noise. To address this issue, we developed an autoencoder model based on a deep learning framework (i.e., Pytorch) to automate the accurate extraction of coseismic displacement from Interferometric SAR (InSAR) interferograms. We constructed a training dataset using simulated interferograms. Our trained model performed well for interferograms with real noise. When applied to worldwide real earthquakes of various rupture styles, the model produced clear coseismic displacement with less noise and a better fit to coseismic fault models compared to the differential InSAR method without noise correction. Additionally, it achieved co-seismic deformation similar to popular InSAR time series and GNSS methods. The approach will enhance the proceduralization and popularization of InSAR applications in earthquake monitoring, providing improved constraints on the kinematic characteristics of earthquakes.",

        "abstract": "With increasing density and heterogeneity in unlicensed wireless networks, traditional MAC protocols, such as Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) in Wi-Fi networks, are experiencing performance degradation. This is manifested in increased collisions and extended backoff times, leading to diminished spectrum efficiency and protocol coordination. Addressing these issues, this paper proposes a deep-learning-based MAC paradigm, dubbed DL-MAC, which leverages spectrum data readily available from energy detection modules in wireless devices to achieve the MAC functionalities of channel access, rate adaptation, and channel switch. First, we utilize DL-MAC to realize a joint design of channel access and rate adaptation. Subsequently, we integrate the capability of channel switching into DL-MAC, enhancing its functionality from single-channel to multi-channel operations. Specifically, the DL-MAC protocol incorporates a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for channel selection and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for the joint design of channel access and rate adaptation. We conducted real-world data collection within the 2.4 GHz frequency band to validate the effectiveness of DL-MAC. Experimental results demonstrate that DL-MAC exhibits significantly superior performance compared to traditional algorithms in both single and multi-channel environments, and also outperforms single-function designs. Additionally, the performance of DL-MAC remains robust, unaffected by channel switch overheads within the evaluation range.",

In the experimental stage, 1288 mortar samples were produced from 322 different clinker specimens and compressive strength tests were performed on these samples. Chemical properties of the clinker samples were also determined. In the modeling stage, these experimental results were used to construct the models. In the models tricalcium silicate (<TEX>$C_3S$</TEX>), dicalcium silicate (<TEX>$C_2S$</TEX>), tricalcium aluminate (<TEX>$C_3A$</TEX>), tetracalcium alumina ferrite (<TEX>$C_4AF$</TEX>), blaine values, specific gravity and age of samples were used as inputs and the compressive strength of clinker samples was used as output. The approximate reasoning ability of the models compared using some statistical parameters. As a result, ANN has shown satisfying relation with experimental results and suggests an alternative approach to evaluate compressive strength estimation of clinker mortars using related inputs. Furthermore MLR model showed a poor ability to predict.",

The models were formulated based on results obtained from laboratory experiments. The variables considered in the study are the quantity of cement and water-cement ratio. Feed forward neural network and Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation algorithm were used for training algorithm in ANN. Amongst the total data, approximately 70% of the data was considered for training, 15% for testing and the remaining 15% has been considered for validation. The developed models had more accuracy with minimum error and had a higher correlation with the correlation coef&amp;#64257;cients of 0.916 and 0.955 were obtained for the training and testing data of compressive strength prediction, 0.949 and 0.937 respectively for split tensile strength prediction, 0.926 and 0.928 respectively for prediction of flexural strength.

        "abstract": "Hemp bio-composite (HBC) is a sustainable material that can be considered as a “carbon negative” or “better-than-zero-carbon” because it absorbs more carbon from its surrounding than it releases during its manufacturing and application on the field. Because of their eco-friendliness, these bio-composites not only improve structure thermal efficiency but also encourage sustainable construction. However, due to its heterogeneous nature, the majority of the published research has experimentally investigated the characteristics of bio-composites. While the mathematical models remain still a challenge for academics. Therefore, three machine learning methods known as deep neural network (DNN), gene expression programming (GEP), and optimizable Gaussian process regressor (OGPR) are used to build up prediction models for compressive strength (CS) and thermal conductivity (TC) of hemp bio-composite. A total of 86 and 159 experimental values for TC and CS, respectively, were collected from the literature. To formulate the models, the ten most dominant input variables were chosen. To evaluate the performance of the models, various statistical metrics were employed. Based on statistical indicators, the increasing order of prediction capabilities of the established models is DNN>OGPR>GEP. The value of the correlation coefficient (R) for CS models is 0.9893 (GEP), 0.9997 (DNN), and 0.9995 (OGPR). While that for TC models are 0.9847 (GEP), 0.9999 (DNN), and 0.9999 (OGPR). The values of the performance index (ρ) and objective function (OF) are approaching 0. Thus, indicating the outburst performance of the developed models. The comparison of machine learning (ML) models with traditional regression models further confirms the accuracy of the developed models. Furthermore, contour maps analysis was conducted to get an insight into the ranges of input variables that were employed by global researchers to gain higher strength and thermal properties. For the interpretation of the models, Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) analysis was carried out. The result revealed that the influencing trend of input variables is in close agreement with experimental studies. Thus, practitioners and designers to avoid hectic experimental tests to save time and cost can utilize these ML-based developed models in field projects. However, it is recommended to use more updated and extensive data to further validate the models and utilize other ML algorithms and post hoc interpretation techniques for the model's explanations.",

        "abstract": "Watershed models are powerful tools for simulating the effect of watershed processes and management on soil and water resources. However, no comprehensive guidance is available to facilitate model evaluation in terms of the accuracy of simulated data compared to measured flow and constituent values. Thus, the objectives of this research were to: (1) determine recommended model evaluation techniques (statistical and graphical), (2) review reported ranges of values and corresponding performance ratings for the recommended statistics, and (3) establish guidelines for model evaluation based on the review results and project-specific considerations; all of these objectives focus on simulation of streamflow and transport of sediment and nutrients. These objectives were achieved with a thorough review of relevant literature on model application and recommended model evaluation methods. Based on this analysis, we recommend that three quantitative statistics, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias (PBIAS), and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR), in addition to the graphical techniques, be used in model evaluation. The following model evaluation performance ratings were established for each recommended statistic. In general, model simulation can be judged as satisfactory if NSE > 0.50 and RSR < 0.70, and if PBIAS + 25% for streamflow, PBIAS + 55% for sediment, and PBIAS + 70% for N and P. For PBIAS, constituent-specific performance ratings were determined based on uncertainty of measured data. Additional considerations related to model evaluation guidelines are also discussed. These considerations include: single-event simulation, quality and quantity of measured data, model calibration procedure, evaluation time step, and project scope and magnitude. A case study illustrating the application of the model evaluation guidelines is also provided.",

        "abstract": "Self-compacting mortar (SCM) has superior workability and long-term durable performance compared to traditional mortar. The strength of SCM, including both its compressive and flexural strengths, is a crucial property that is determined by appropriate curing conditions and mix design parameters. In the context of materials science, predicting the strength of SCM is challenging because of multiple influencing factors. This study employed machine learning techniques to establish SCM strength prediction models. Based on ten different input parameters, the strength of SCM specimens were predicted using two different types of hybrid machine learning (HML) models, namely Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. HML models were trained and tested by experimental data from 320 test specimens. In addition, the Bayesian optimization method was utilized to fine tune the hyperparameters of the employed algorithms, and cross-validation was employed to partition the database into multiple folds for a more thorough exploration of the hyperparameter space while providing a more accurate assessment of the model’s predictive power. The results show that both HML models can successfully predict the SCM strength values with high accuracy, and the Bo-XGB model demonstrated higher accuracy (R2 = 0.96 for training and R2 = 0.91 for testing phases) for predicting flexural strength with low error. In terms of compressive strength prediction, the employed BO-RF model performed very well, with R2 = 0.96 for train and R2 = 0.88 testing stages with minor errors. Moreover, the SHAP algorithm, permutation importance and leave-one-out importance score were used for sensitivity analysis to explain the prediction process and interpret the governing input variable parameters of the proposed HML models. Finally, the outcomes of this study might be applied to guide the future mix design of SCM specimens.",

        "abstract": "Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB LightGBM. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.",

On the other hand, automatically obtained mechanical properties of these composites, especially plastic concrete (PC) made by adding bentonite clay to the ordinary concrete mixture, can be useful in reducing the cost and optimising the time of the cutoff wall construction in earth dam projects. For this purpose, four computational intelligence and statistical approaches, including support vector machine (SVM), multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), group method of data handling (GMDH), and response surface methodology (RSM), were used in this article to auto-estimate the compressive strength (CS) of PC. To do this, a comprehensive dataset published in the research literature was used. Also, the models validity was assessed by both external validations of the proposed approaches and Monte-Carlo uncertainty analysis. Finally, each input variable in the models has been studied parametrically over wide ranges to provide practical results to engineers. Comparing the results with the existing literature indicates the acceptable accuracy of the developed models in this study due to optimisation in the speed of developed models and also the less complexity of the proposed ones.",
