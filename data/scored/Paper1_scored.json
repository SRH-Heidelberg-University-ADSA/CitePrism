    "abstract": "The flexible pavement system consists of layers that are made up of a blend of aggregates and bitumen. To design flexible pavement systems that are both safe and environmentally sustainable, it is essential to have an accurate understanding of the resilient modulus (Mr) of the compacted subgrade soil. Mr refers to the ability of the soil to resist deformation under repeated loads. Thus, a critical parameter affects the performance and longevity of pavement systems. This study employs machine learning (ML) algorithms such as individual and ensemble learners using an extensive database of 2813 data points. These include dry unit weight, weighted plasticity index, confining stress, deviator stress, moisture content, and the number of freeze-thaw cycles (FT). The individual or weak learners were incorporated to create strong and robust ensemble learners by employing techniques such as bagging, adaptive boosting, and random forest (RF). Ensemble learning methods were used to improve the performance of individual learners, such as support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT), by combining their predictions. To achieve the highest R2 value, a total of twenty bagging and boosting sub-models were trained and optimized. The validation of the test data was carried out through K-Fold cross-validation, utilizing metrics such as R2, MAE, and RMSE. The developed models were rigorously tested using statistical indices (MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RMLSE) to verify their predictive accuracy, reliability, and trustworthiness. The findings indicate that the integration of bagging and boosting techniques improves the efficiency of individual machine learning (ML) models. The combination of RF and DT utilizing bagging resulted in the most reliable performance, achieving an R2 value of 0.9 and demonstrating minimum errors. In general, the implementation of the ensemble algorithm in ML improved the overall prediction accuracy of the model. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the prediction of the resilient modulus (Mr) of the subgrade is primarily influenced by dry density, confining stress, and deviator stress. Moreover, a graphical user interface (GUI) is developed for practical implantation."

        "abstract": "Intelligent compaction (IC) has been successfully used for soil and base compaction of highways. However, the application of IC technology to monitor the construction quality of asphalt pavement faces complications with compaction processing. This study monitored the compaction process of asphalt layers using an IC-based method. The compaction data were first collected during the construction of a local road in Mardan, Pakistan, including IC data, in-place density, and temperature at the asphalt layer surface. The collected IC data were then used to compute the intelligent compaction measurement values (ICMVs). The support vector regression analysis was performed to predict the roller amplitude and in-place density using the ICMVs. To explore the correlations in compaction measuring/monitoring indicators, this study also explored the correlations between the ICMVs with core density, temperature, and amplitude. Experiment results indicated that the predicted roller amplitude values from the support vector regression model were close to the measured ones. There were high correlations between the roller amplitudes and temperatures with the compaction measurement values (CMVs). In contrast, the correlation between the in-place core densities and CMV values was low. Additionally, the CMVs of the backward pass were higher than the forward one in each compaction cycle because the pavement density increased and the air void decreased after each forward pass.",

        "abstract": "The amount of waste materials such as dredged materials (DM) and waste glass (WG) have been growing exponentially since the middle of the 20th century. The most important problem created by them is the lack of space to be used for storage beside ecological, economic, and environmental problems. The purpose of the presented study is to contribute to the elimination of the mentioned problems by assessing the re-use of related wastes as pavement material. Therefore initially, DM was treated with additives at various contents that are powdered waste glass (GP) (5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %), lime (5 %) and cement (5 %). Following, a series of experimental studies and calculations such as Proctor, California bearing ratio (CBR), resilient modulus (MR) were carried out on the blends to define the geotechnical properties of them. Additionally, a cost analysis was made according to the obtained test results and the design inputs for a typical flexible pavement to determine the effect of the additives on the cost of the road construction. The underlying mechanism process of determined effects was defined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The obtained results indicate that CBR of the DM is 5.6 % which means has sufficient strength and stiffness for being used as a subgrade. Increasing the GP content in the blends contributes to achieving more desired results both geotechnically and indirectly economically. Combined use of cement and GP on DM increases the CBR value up to 83 %. This translates to an 89 % reduction in the structural number (SN) and 170 % decrease in cost index. The results of microstructural analysis indicate that the geotechnical improvement of treated DM was provided by CSH and CAH formations. Consequently, the additives used improve index and stiffness properties of DM which means a decrease in the layer thickness in road construction and therefore a decrease in the cost. The presented study confirms the usability of cement, PG, and lime-treated DM as pavement material, according to criteria specified by the Federal Highway Administration.",

        "abstract": "Pavement maintenance presents significant financial challenges, driving researchers to explore innovative approaches that can prolong pavement service life and reduce costly interventions. The objective of this research is to examine the feasibility of utilizing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers to self-heal asphalt pavements. A comprehensive mechanical testing strategy was developed to evaluate the self-healing capability of several hot mix asphalt (HMA) mixtures at the micro- and macro-level. Moreover, to assess the healing behavior of macro fractures in PVA-fiber-reinforced HMA, semi-circular bending (SCB) specimens were loaded until peak load and then allowed to heal at varying time intervals and temperatures for several loading cycles. Healing indices developed based on SCB stiffness, strength, and beam fatigue technique were utilized to measure the self-healing ability of control and reinforced mixtures. By comparing different concentrations of PVA fibers with a control HMA, the optimal fiber dosage was determined based on newly developed healing indices. This study also investigated the impact of healing time and different temperatures on healing. The results demonstrated that PVA fibers expedited the healing process, effectively healing macro-, meso-, and micro-cracks. The most effective recovery occurred with 0.3% fiber content at 40°C for a 2 h duration. Incorporating PVA fibers into asphalt pavements presents a promising solution for extending pavement service life and can be helpful in reducing maintenance costs.",

Our innovative method amalgamates the benefits of deep learning and conventional simulation to preserve the guiding motion and temporal coherence of the reproduced fluid. We infer surface velocities by encoding and decoding spatiotemporal features of surface sequences, and a 3D CNN is used to generate the volumetric velocity field, which is then combined with 3D labels of obstacles and boundaries. Concurrently, we employ a network to estimate the fluid's physical properties. To progressively evolve the flow field over time, we input the reconstructed velocity field and estimated parameters into the physical simulator as the initial state. Our approach yields promising results for both synthetic fluid generated by different fluid solvers and captured real fluid. The developed framework naturally lends itself to a variety of graphics applications, such as 1) effective reproductions of fluid behaviors visually congruent with the observed surface motion, and 2) physics-guided re-editing of fluid scenes. Extensive experiments affirm that our novel method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches for 3D fluid inverse modeling and animation in graphics.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a novel hybrid intelligent approach using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Equilibrium Optimiser (EO) (ELM-EO) for predicting resilient modulus, Mr of Unbound Granular Materials (UGMs). Fourteen various blends of Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) with Recycled Clay Masonry (RCM), and Electric Arc Furnace Steel (EAFS) slag with limestone aggregates were tested in the laboratory using routine and advanced tests. The laboratory Mr testing produced 224 measurements based on the average of triplicate samples for each blend. The performance of the ELM-EO approach was evaluated and compared with conventional regression, ELM-biogeography-based optimisation (BBO) (ELM-BBO) and ELM-genetic algorithm (ELM-GA) approaches using the same input properties. The inputs used for the Mr prediction are the bulk stress, percent of RCM, and/or percent of EAFS. The results demonstrate that the performance of ELM-EO and ELM-BBO approaches is better than ELM-GA and regression approaches for predicting Mr. The overall statistical measures of the proposed approaches show that the ELM-EO approach ranks first as it outperforms the other approaches with coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.924 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 37.08 MPa.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, 3D laser scanning technology has been applied to tunnel engineering. Although more intelligent than traditional measurement technology, it is still challenging to estimate the real-time deformation of NATM tunnel excavation from laser detection and ranging point clouds. To further improve the measurement accuracy of 3D laser scanning technology in the tunnel construction process, this paper proposes an improved Kriging filtering algorithm. Considering the spatial correlation of the described object, the optimization method of point cloud grid filtering is studied. By analyzing the full-space deformation field of the tunnel lining, the deformation information of the measuring points on the surface of the tunnel lining is extracted. Based on the actual project, through the on-site monitoring comparison test, the three-dimensional laser point cloud data are grid processed and analyzed, and the deformation data obtained from the test are compared with the data measured by traditional methods. The experimental results show that the Kriging filtering algorithm can not only efficiently identify and extract the tunnel profile visualization data but also efficiently and accurately obtain the tunnel deformation. The measurement results obtained by using the proposed technology are in good agreement with those obtained by using traditional monitoring methods. Therefore, tunnel deformation monitoring based on 3D laser scanning technology can better reflect the evolution of the tunnel full-space deformation field under certain environmental conditions and can provide an effective safety warning for tunnel construction.",

        "abstract": "AbstractAlthough numerous studies have been undertaken to examine the potential of C&D wastes in pavement structures, limited research to date has developed constitutive models for the resilient modulus (Mr) of C&D wastes. In this study, machine learning algorithms: artificial neural network (ANN); Support Vector Regression (SVR); and Random Forest Regression (RFR) were utilised for estimating the Mr of C&D wastes blended with tire-derived aggregate (TDA). A database of repeated load triaxial test results on C&D/TDA blends including stress-state parameters, Mr values and other influential parameters on the Mr such as physical properties of the blends, as well as the California bearing ratio (CBR) test results was utilised for developing the machine learning models. The predictive performance of the developed algorithms was assessed using statistical indices and several validation stages. The results exhibited the robustness of machine learning algorithms used for predicting the Mr of C&D/TDA wastes, with R2train, R2test, MAPEtrain, MAPEtest between 0.996–0.997, 0.911–0.997, 0.037–0.068, and 0.037–0.067, respectively. The sensitivity analysis results indicated that the optimum moisture content and CBR had the highest impacts on the Mr of C&D/TDA blends.KEYWORDS: Demolition wastespavement geotechnicsresilient modulusmachine learningtire derived aggregates Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Additional informationFundingThis work was supported by the State Government of Victoria.",

In this study, an in-situ modulus detector (IMD) with flat, wedge, and cone tips is employed to estimate the resilient modulus. The specimens with three different levels of water content are compacted, and the dynamic responses for two hammer drop heights are analysed. For all specimens, elastic waves are acquired to estimate the shear modulus and Poisson's ratio using bender and piezo-disk elements. The resilient modulus estimated from the IMD is compared with the lightweight deflectometer (LWD) modulus. The experimental results show a stronger relationship between the flat and wedge tips than between the cone and wedge tips. Furthermore, higher drop heights result in strong relationships between the resilient, shear, and LWD moduli. This study proposes an intrinsic design and verification of an IMD for reliable resilient modulus estimation in pavement design.",

In the present study, a systematic approach was adopted for the descriptive analysis and estimation of . from routine soil properties using data from Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) and considering the spatial variability of the soil properties. Descriptive analysis was executed using non-parametric correlation and principal component analysis (PCA), while the estimation was done using three machine learning methods which include gradient boosting regression (GBR), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural network (ANN). Based on the PCA, four factors which explained a total of 77.5% variance in the data had significant influence on the . These include the effect of moisture-induced changes on the soil consistency limits and physical condition, effect of the soil clay content, effect of the soil gradation and effect of the soil stress state. Various factors of the machine learning methods such as the learning rate, number of clusters and number of hidden layers had a significant effect on the prediction accuracy. The three machine learning methods were satisfactory for the prediction based on R2 values which were generally above 0.9. Also, when considering spatial variability of routine soil properties, the GBR and ANFIS have a comparative advantage over the ANN, since they exhibited a high stability in the prediction for both the training and testing dataset.",

First, a new resilient modulus model incorporating stress dependence and moisture dependence was proposed. Second, prediction models were developed to conveniently and accurately determine model parameters of SWCC and resilient modulus model. In order to characterise the moisture dependence of subgrade soils, the matric suction was added into the proposed model. The matric suction was measured by the pressure plate test and the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) was used to determine the matric suction value at any given moisture contents. In order to develop prediction models for model parameters of SWCC and resilient modulus model, the laboratory experiments and multiple regression analysis were conducted on 22 soil samples. A series of performance-related soil properties were measured and used to develop the coefficients prediction models. The developed coefficients prediction models using the performance-related soil properties have high R-squared values and were validated by comparing the measured and predicted values of resilient modulus. Therefore, when the basic physical properties of soils were obtained, the resilient modulus can be predicted for the subgrade soils at any given matric suctions and stress states.",

The immediate effects were examined by performing MR test (using triaxial dynamic-system) for specimens immediately after applying successive FT cycles. For assessment of long-term effects, the specimens were subjected to 15 FT cycles and then thawing in a humidity room for different recovery periods up to 250 days before commencing MR tests. The results indicated a reduction in MR by about three times due to FT cycles regardless of lime-treatment. This reduction mostly took place after first FT cycle and showed a dependency on FT cycle number. On long-term performance, the reduction was not entirely recovered for all soils, and reducing the designed values of MR is recommended when pavement subgrades are to be subjected to FT cycles even once a year.",

        "abstract": "The use of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) aggregate materials in road construction reduces natural resource depletion and promotes the recycling of RAP materials for other applications. However, product variability and low resilient moduli characteristics often limit RAP applications in road bases. Stabilization of RAP materials with cement was hence attempted in a research study to evaluate the effectiveness of cement treatments in enhancing resilient characteristics of RAP aggregates. The present paper describes the results from a series of resilient modulus tests that were conducted in a laboratory environment using a repeated load triaxial test setup. The effects of three different cement dosages and various confining and deviatoric stress levels on the resilient modulus (MR) response of treated RAP materials were studied. MR values of untreated and cement-treated RAP aggregates ranged from 180 to 340 MPa and 200 to 515 MPa, respectively, which reveal the enhancements with cement treatment. Regression modeling analyses of MR test results, by using two- and three-parameter models, are also presented. The analyses show that both models are reasonably capable of capturing the effects of stress levels on treated RAP resilient properties. Test results were also analyzed to determine structural coefficients for pavement design purposes, which ranged from 0.16 to 0.22, suggesting a greater structural support of cement-treated RAP layers when compared with untreated aggregates.",

Recently, scholars and researchers have attempted to deploy various kinds of sensors on point machines for anomaly detection and/or incipient fault detection using date-driven algorithms. However, challenges arise when deploying condition monitoring and fault detection to trackside point machines in practical applications. This article begins by reviewing studies on fault and anomaly detection in point machines, encompassing employed methods and evaluation metrics. It subsequently conducts an in-depth analysis of point machines and outlines the envisioned intelligent fault detection system.

        "abstract": "Accurate and efficient parameter identification along with uncertainty quantification in nonlinear systems is crucial for enabling practical and reliable structural health monitoring and digital twinning. This paper presents a novel procedure for estimating parameters that combines Bayesian filters and truncated probability density functions (PDFs). To simplify the state-space equations, only model parameters are incorporated in the state equations, whereas the measurement equations are implicitly considered in the state vector of displacement and velocity. This simplification enables the unified implementation of three different types of Bayesian filters: the unscented Kalman filter, third-degree cubature Kalman filter, and fifth-degree cubature Kalman filter. Consequently, it facilitates the seamless integration of complex numerical models into the parameter identification procedure. To improve the robustness of the proposed method, the truncated PDF is employed to enforce constraints that prevent the covariance matrix from becoming singular. The applicability and accuracy of the proposed method were evaluated using a 10-story numerical example and a 12-story shake-table model. Based on the selected parameters for tuning, the estimated results are consistent with both the simulated and experimental data, demonstrating that the Bayesian filters can estimate parameters and quantify their uncertainties. Comparison of the estimation accuracy, computational cost, and efficiency index among the three types of Bayesian filters reveals that the fifth-degree cubature Kalman filter has the highest accuracy. When dealing with less complex structural models, the unscented Kalman filter demonstrates superior efficiency. These findings are useful for finite-element model updating and assessment of structural performance.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a comparative analysis of individual and ensemble learning algorithms (ELAs) to predict the compressive strength (CS) and flexural strength (FS) of plastic concrete. Multilayer perceptron neuron network (MLPNN), Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and decision tree (DT) were used as base learners, which were then combined with bagging and Adaboost methods to improve the predictive performance. In addition, gene expression programming (GEP) was used to develop computational equations that can be used to predict the CS and FS of plastic concrete. An extensive database containing 357 and 125 data points was obtained from the literature, and the eight most impactful ingredients were used in the model’s development. The accuracy of all models was assessed using several statistical measures, including an error matrix, Akaike information criterion (AIC), K-fold cross-validation, and other external validation equations. Furthermore, sensitivity and SHAP analysis were performed to evaluate input variables' relative significance and impact on the anticipated CS and FS. Based on statistical measures and other validation criteria, GEP outpaces all other individual models, whereas, in ELAs, the SVR ensemble with Adaboost and RF modified with the Bagging technique demonstrated superior performance. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and sensitivity analysis reveal that plastic, cement, water, and the age of the specimens have the highest influence, while superplasticizer has the lowest impact, which is consistent with experimental studies. Moreover, GUI and GEP-based simple mathematical correlation can enhance the practical scope of this study and be an effective tool for the pre-mix design of plastic concrete.",

        "abstract": "The new Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) uses the subgrade resilient modulus (MR) as the key input parameter to represent the subgrade soil behavior for pavement design. The resilient modulus increases with an increase in confining pressure, whereas, for an increase in deviatoric stress, it increases for granular soils and decreases for fine-grained soils. The value of MR is highly stress dependent, with the stress state (i.e., bulk stress) a function of the position of the materials in the pavement structure and applied traffic loading. Applying excessive vertical stress at the top of the subgrade without knowing the appropriate stress state can result in permanent deformation. In situ stress must be calculated so the correct resilient modulus can be determined. To facilitate the implementation of MEPDG, this study develops a methodology to select the appropriate subgrade resilient modulus for predicting rutting and IRI. A comprehensive research methodology was undertaken to study the effect of in situ or undisturbed subgrade MR on pavement performance using the MEPDG. Results show that MR obtained from in situ stress is approximately 1.4 times higher than the MR estimate from NCHRP-285. Thus, the in situ stress significantly affects the calculation of subgrade MR and, subsequently, the use of MR in the predicted rutting, with IRI using the AASHTOWare pavement mechanistic-empirical design. Results also show that the pavement sections were classified as in “Good” and “Fair” conditions for rutting and IRI, respectively, considering in situ MR.",

        "abstract": "The Maine Department of Transportation commissioned this study to examine methods of obtaining resilient modulus for use in pavement design. Resilient modulus is a measure of soil layer stiffness and is highly subjective to density, moisture content, soil fabric structure, compaction method, laboratory equipment compliance, and technician skill. As a result, several alternative test methods have been proposed. These alternative test methods include resilient modulus correlation to results from torsional shear and resonant column tests, a modified gyratory test machine normally used for testing asphalt concrete specimens, and a small-scale falling weight deflectometer (FWD) device. The study used resilient modulus test data of 14 Maine soils published by Law Engineering (1992). Soil index property data and FWD data were obtained from the Strategic Highway Research Program's Long Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) database. Three methods for determining resilient modulus were examined: (1) backcalculation of resilient modulus using computer software, (2) determination of the K sub n constants for various constitutive resilient modulus equations by linear regression analysis, and (3) correlations between resilient modulus and soil property data and stress state. Computer backcalculation was done using MODCOMP 4 and MODULUS 5.1. The backcalculated resilient moduli did not compare well with the laboratory moduli when the programs automatically estimated the depth to hard layer and outliers were neglected. The K sub n constants for 7 common constitutive relationships were developed for 14 Maine soils using linear regression. Two equations correlating resilient modulus to dry density, water content, grain size distribution and stress state were also generated from linear regression techniques. California bearing ratio (CBR) does not correlate well with resilient modulus, therefore, no correlations involving CBR were examined.",

        "abstract": "Compacted soils are widely used as the subgrade layer for pavements. Knowledge of the mechanical properties of subgrade soils under cyclic and static loading conditions and their variation under the influence of environmental factors is required for the rational design of pavements based on mechanistic methods. This paper presents an experimental investigation of the cyclic and static moduli and the strength properties of seven different compacted Canadian subgrade soils considering the variation in the post-compaction moisture content. Cyclic triaxial tests were performed to reliably determine the resilient modulus (MR). Unconfined compression tests, which allow an unloading-reloading loop at 1% strain, were performed to determine the deviator stress (Su1%) at 1% strain, the reloading elastic modulus (E1%) at 1% strain and the unconfined compressive strength (qu) at failure. The physical properties, the chemical and mineralogical compositions, and the soil-water characteristics of these soils were also determined. Relationships were developed to predict the MR from the Su1%, E1%, qu and soil physical properties for the investigated subgrade soils because the experimental determination of MR is both expensive and time-consuming. The studies presented in this paper provide useful information and approaches that can be used to promote the implementation of mechanistic pavement design methods using simple techniques.",

        "abstract": "Twenty-five reinforced concrete (RC) columns of section size 250 × 250 mm were designed and tested to study the seismic response considering the effect of loading case, strengthening method, and the predamage level, containing 21 columns reinforced with high-performance ferrocement laminate (HPFL)-bonded steel plates (BSPs), i.e., the intact strengthened columns (ISCs), earthquake-damaged strengthened columns (EDSCs), corrosion-damaged strengthened columns (CSCs) and coupled-predamaged strengthened columns (CPSCs). The bearing capacity of the specimens under the four different types of loading methods is ranked as follows: uniaxial compression–bending–shear (CBS) members, biaxial CBS members, biaxial CBS-torsion (CBST) members, and uniaxial CBST members. Compared with nonstrengthened specimens, the cracks of the strengthened RC columns are more fully developed, and the failure modes have been changed after strengthening. The failure modes and load–deformation curves had little significant difference for the strengthened RC columns with different damage under combined loading levels. The bearing capacity of strengthened RC columns with the applied loading of 400 kN improved, which increased to 60.1%–114.7%, 29.9%–103%, 65.2%–127%, and 49.2%–104.5% for ISCs, EDSCs, CSCs, and CPSCs, respectively. Moreover, the bearing capacity of specimens decreased due to the existence of horizontal eccentricity. Finally, based on the degraded trilinear restoring force model, the strengthened influence coefficient for loading α and displacement β and the torsion influence coefficient for loading γ and displacement ξ were introduced. A modified restoring force model of RC columns was presented, reflecting the loading method, predamage level, and strengthening method. The theoretical calculation values align with the test load–deformation curves, and the mean absolute error is almost less than 15%.",

        "abstract": "To avoid time-consuming, costly, and laborious experimental tests that require skilled personnel, an effort has been made to formulate the depth of wear of fly-ash concrete using a comparative study of machine learning techniques, namely random forest regression (RFR) and gene expression programming (GEP). A widespread database comprising 216 experimental records was constructed from available research. The database includes depth of wear as a response parameter and nine different explanatory variables, i.e., cement content, fly ash, water content, fine and coarse aggregate, plasticizer, air-entraining agent, age of concrete, and time of testing. The performance of the models was judged via statistical metrics. The GEP model gives better performance with R2 and ρ equals 0.9667 and 0.0501 respectively and meet with the external validation criterion suggested in the previous literature. The k-fold cross-validation also verifies the accurateness of the model by evaluating R2, RSE, MAE, and RMSE. The sensitivity analysis of GEP equation indicated that the time of testing is the influential parameter. The results of this research can help the designers, practitioners, and researchers to quickly estimate the depth of wear of fly-ash concrete thus shortening its ecological susceptibilities that push to sustainable and faster construction from the viewpoint of environmentally friendly waste management.",

Workability, linear-shrinkage, rheological properties, flexural and compressive strength, air content and water absorption tests were conducted. Results reveal that by addition of nano media in cement matrix workability, shrinkage, air content, and water absorption adamantly reduces as compared to control mixtures. On the other hand yield stress, plastic viscosity, compressive and flexural strength enhances significantly. The shrinkage response of SCM-3 and CCM-3 depicts reduction of 66% and 61% respectively. Furthermore, yield stress and plastic viscosity increase 53% and 12% respectively. By addition of nano media deviation in crack propagation, more nucleation sites, capturing the micro voids, filling the pores and dense packing of the hydrated products were found. Increase in compressive strength and flexural strength was observed. Hence hybrid nano media can be intruded as a potential candidate in cement matrix for enhancing the structural properties.

This is manifested in increased collisions and extended backoff times, leading to diminished spectrum efficiency and protocol coordination. Addressing these issues, this paper proposes a deep-learning-based MAC paradigm, dubbed DL-MAC, which leverages spectrum data readily available from energy detection modules in wireless devices to achieve the MAC functionalities of channel access, rate adaptation, and channel switch. First, we utilize DL-MAC to realize a joint design of channel access and rate adaptation. Subsequently, we integrate the capability of channel switching into DL-MAC, enhancing its functionality from single-channel to multi-channel operations. Specifically, the DL-MAC protocol incorporates a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for channel selection and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for the joint design of channel access and rate adaptation. We conducted real-world data collection within the 2.4 GHz frequency band to validate the effectiveness of DL-MAC. Experimental results demonstrate that DL-MAC exhibits significantly superior performance compared to traditional algorithms in both single and multi-channel environments, and also outperforms single-function designs. Additionally, the performance of DL-MAC remains robust, unaffected by channel switch overheads within the evaluation range.",

In this study, machine learning approaches and artificial intelligence python‐based approaches have been utilized to predict the mechanical behaviour of HSC. The data to be used in the modelling consist of several input parameters such as cement, water, fine aggregate, and coarse aggregate in combination with a superplasticizer. Empirical relation with mathematical expression has been proposed using engineering programming. The efficiency of the models is assessed by statistical analysis with the error by using MAE, RRMSE, RSE, and comparisons were made between regression models. Moreover, variable intensity and correlation have shown that deep learning can be used to know the exact amount of materials in civil engineering rather than doing experimental work. The expression tree, as well as normalization of the graph, depicts significant accuracy between target and output values. The results reveal that machine learning proposed adamant accuracy and has elucidated performance in the prediction aspect.",

        "abstract": "Compressive strength is one of the important property of concrete and depends on many factors. Most of the concrete compressive strength predictive models mainly rely on available literature data, which are too simple to consider all the contributing factors. This study adopted a new approach to predict the compressive strength of sugarcane bagasse ash concrete (SCBAC). A vast amount of data from the literature study and fifteen laboratory tested concrete samples with different dosage of bagasse ash, were respectively used to calibrate and validate the models. The novel Gene Expression Programming, Multiple Linear Regression and Multiple Non-Linear Regression were used to model SCBAC compressive strength. The water cement ratio, bagasse ash percent replacement, quantity of fine and coarse aggregate and cement content were used as an input for models development. Various statistical indicators, i.e., NSE, R2 and RMSE were used to assess the performance of the models. The results indicated a strong correlation between observed and predicted values with NSE and R2 both above 0.8 during calibration and validation for the Gene Expression Programming (GEP). The outcomes from GEP outclassed all the models to predict SCBAC compressive strength. The validity of the model is further verified using data of fifteen tests conducted in the laboratory. Moreover, the cement content in the mix was revealed as the most sensitive parameter followed by water cement ratio form sensitivity analysis. The GEP fulfilled all the criteria for external validity. The simple formulae derived in this study could be used reliably for the prediction of SCBAC compressive strength.",

        "abstract": "Fly ash (FA) is a residual from thermal industries that has been effectively utilized in the production of FA‐based geopolymer concrete (FGPC). To avoid time‐consuming and costly experimental procedures, soft computing techniques, namely, random forest regression (RFR) and gene expression programming (GEP), are used in this study to develop an empirical model for the prediction of compressive strength of FGPC. A widespread, reliable, and consistent database of compressive strength of FGPC is set up via a comprehensive literature review. The database consists of 298 compressive strength data points. The influential parameters that are considered as input variables for modelling are curing temperature ( T ), curing time ( t ), age of the specimen ( A ), the molarity of NaOH solution ( M ), percent SiO 2 solids to water ratio (% S / W ) in sodium silicate (Na 2 SiO 3 ) solution, percent volume of total aggregate ( % A G ), fine aggregate to the total aggregate ratio ( F / A G ), sodium oxide (Na 2 O) to water ratio ( N / W ) in Na 2 SiO 3 solution, alkali or activator to the FA ratio ( A L / F A ), Na 2 SiO 3 to NaOH ratio ( N s / N o ), percent plasticizer (% P ), and extra water added as percent FA ( E W %). RFR is an ensemble algorithm and gives outburst performance as compared to GEP. However, GEP proposed an empirical expression that can be used to estimate the compressive strength of FGPC. The accuracy and performance of both models are evaluated via statistical error checks, and external validation is considered. The proposed GEP equation is used for sensitivity analysis and parametric study and then compared with nonlinear and linear regression expressions.",

        "abstract": "Hemp bio-composite (HBC) is a sustainable material that can be considered as a “carbon negative” or “better-than-zero-carbon” because it absorbs more carbon from its surrounding than it releases during its manufacturing and application on the field. Because of their eco-friendliness, these bio-composites not only improve structure thermal efficiency but also encourage sustainable construction. However, due to its heterogeneous nature, the majority of the published research has experimentally investigated the characteristics of bio-composites. While the mathematical models remain still a challenge for academics. Therefore, three machine learning methods known as deep neural network (DNN), gene expression programming (GEP), and optimizable Gaussian process regressor (OGPR) are used to build up prediction models for compressive strength (CS) and thermal conductivity (TC) of hemp bio-composite. A total of 86 and 159 experimental values for TC and CS, respectively, were collected from the literature. To formulate the models, the ten most dominant input variables were chosen. To evaluate the performance of the models, various statistical metrics were employed. Based on statistical indicators, the increasing order of prediction capabilities of the established models is DNN>OGPR>GEP. The value of the correlation coefficient (R) for CS models is 0.9893 (GEP), 0.9997 (DNN), and 0.9995 (OGPR). While that for TC models are 0.9847 (GEP), 0.9999 (DNN), and 0.9999 (OGPR). The values of the performance index (ρ) and objective function (OF) are approaching 0. Thus, indicating the outburst performance of the developed models. The comparison of machine learning (ML) models with traditional regression models further confirms the accuracy of the developed models. Furthermore, contour maps analysis was conducted to get an insight into the ranges of input variables that were employed by global researchers to gain higher strength and thermal properties. For the interpretation of the models, Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) analysis was carried out. The result revealed that the influencing trend of input variables is in close agreement with experimental studies. Thus, practitioners and designers to avoid hectic experimental tests to save time and cost can utilize these ML-based developed models in field projects. However, it is recommended to use more updated and extensive data to further validate the models and utilize other ML algorithms and post hoc interpretation techniques for the model's explanations.",

        "abstract": "With the widespread use of indoor positioning technology, the need for high-precision positioning services is rising; nevertheless, there are several challenges, such as the difficulty of simulating the distribution of interior location data and the enormous inaccuracy of probability computation. As a result, this paper proposes three different neural network model comparisons for indoor location based on WiFi fingerprint - indoor location algorithm based on improved back propagation neural network model, RSSI indoor location algorithm based on neural network angle change, and RSSI indoor location algorithm based on depth neural network angle change - to raise accurately predict indoor location coordinates. Changing the action range of the activation function in the standard back-propagation neural network model achieves the goal of accurately predicting location coordinates. The revised back-propagation neural network model has strong stability and enhances indoor positioning accuracy based on experimental comparisons of loss rate (loss), accuracy rate (acc), and cumulative distribution function (CDF).",

        "abstract": "Motion control is crucial for multilegged robot locomotion and task completion. This study aims to address the fundamental challenges of inadequate foot tracking and weak leg compliance control in multilegged robot motions. The first section summarizes and discusses the feasibility and operability of smooth motion for multilegged robots based on the necessary conditions and application value of walking over complicated and unstructured terrain. The second to fourth sections present a qualitative research method of literature review to study the effects of several factors on the smooth motion of multilegged robots, including foot force perception and motion planning, active compliance control, gait stability, and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) control. We conducted a case analysis of multilegged robots using traditional Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), biomimetic Central Pattern Generator (CPG), and DRL control in the latest international open-source projects to help readers further follow the latest open-source algorithms for legged robot motion control. In addition, we analyze the challenges these influencing factors face in optimization and provide suggestions for effectively promoting the realization of review objectives. In the fifth section, we discuss the challenges of springy gait and intelligent switching control in solving the problems of poor foot tracking and weak leg compliance. We explore and forecast the potential application of the Probability Density Function (PDF) control of the foot force in the smooth motion of multilegged robots. In the sixth section, we systematically discuss, analyze, and summarize the existing problems in this research field. We also highlight the shortcomings of existing research methods, look forward to future research areas, and highlight the obstacles that need to be overcome to promote future research in this field.",

To fully describe the stress state and strain rate condition of material during dynamic loading, a new coordinate system, which is composed of a stress axis and strain rate axis, is employed to present the proposed rate-dependent yield surface. The strain rate is regarded as a variable in applying the consistency condition. The rate-dependent consistency is satisfied strictly during the whole dynamic loading. The nonassociated flow rule is employed to describe the dilatancy behavior of concrete. The loading–unloading criterion based on Ilyushin's postulate is developed into the rate-dependent loading–unloading criterion that can consider reasonably the change of elastic domain caused by strain rate. Furthermore, a three-dimensional (3D) dynamic elastoplastic model of concrete is established within the framework of the rate-dependent consistency condition. Under the dynamic uniaxial compression loading condition, the model characteristics related to rate-dependent consistency condition are discussed and analyzed. Five sets of dynamic experiment results of concrete are employed to evaluate the performance of the model.",

The single modal intrusion detection model cannot fully exploit the rich feature information in the massive network traffic data, resulting in unsatisfactory detection results. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multimodal hybrid parallel network intrusion detection model (MHPN). The proposed model extracts network traffic features from two modalities: the statistical information of network traffic and the original load of traffic, and constructs appropriate neural network models for each modal information. Firstly, a two-branch convolutional neural network is combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to extract the spatio-temporal feature information of network traffic from the original load mode of traffic, and a convolutional neural network is used to extract the feature information of traffic statistics. Then, the feature information extracted from the two modalities is fused and fed to the CosMargin classifier for network traffic classification. The experimental results on the ISCX-IDS 2012 and CIC-IDS-2017 datasets show that the MHPN model outperforms the single-modal models and achieves an average accuracy of 99.98 $ \\% $ . The model also demonstrates strong robustness and a positive sample recognition rate.",

With the increasingly strict vibroacoustic index, the tangential force effects on the vibration are analyzed and investigated, and it shows the contribution of tangential force on electromagnetic vibration cannot be ignored. However, these studies are based mainly on finite element multi-physics models, and experiments are not conducted. Furthermore, the mechanism of tangential force is not clearly explained. In this paper, a special motor stator structure is proposed to explore the effect of tangential force on vibration. First, the analytical calculation of the tangential force and the tangential effect on motor vibration are described. Next, the Theorem of Translation of A Force is introduced to convert the effective tangential tooth force to a radial force couple acting on the stator yoke. Then, a novel motor stator is proposed to investigate the vibration characteristics caused only by tangential force, and the simulation is analyzed. Finally, a vibration test of the prototype is conducted and the result shows the tangential force can induce the radial vibration with corresponding order.",

        "abstract": "Development of Foamed Concrete (FC) and incessant increases in fabrication technology have paved the way for many promising civil engineering applications. Nevertheless, the design of FC requires a large number of experiments to determine the appropriate Compressive Strength (CS). Employment of machine learning algorithms to take advantage of the existing experiments database has been attempted, but model performance can still be improved. In this study, the performance of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was fully analyzed to predict the 28 days CS of FC. Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) were used to statistically analyze the convergence of the modeled results under the effect of random sampling strategies and the network structures selected. Various statistical measures such as Coefficient of Determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were used for validation of model performance. The results show that ANN is a highly efficient predictor of the CS of FC, achieving a maximum R2 value of 0.976 on the training part and an R2 of 0.972 on the testing part, using the optimized C-ANN-[3–4–5–1] structure, which compares with previous published studies. In addition, a sensitivity analysis using Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) over 1000 MCS was also performed to interpret the relationship between the input parameters and 28 days CS of FC. Dry density was found as the variable with the highest impact to predict the CS of FC. The results presented could facilitate and enhance the use of C-ANN in other civil engineering-related problems.",

        "abstract": "Artificial neural network (ANN) models are developed in this study to correlate resilient modulus with routine properties of subgrade soils and state of stress for pavement design application. A database is developed containing grain size distribution, Atterberg limits, standard Proctor, unconfined compression, and resilient modulus results for 97 soils from 16 different counties in Oklahoma. Of these, 63 soils (development data set) are used in training, and the remaining 34 soils (evaluation data set) from two different counties are used in the evaluation of the developed models. A commercial software, STATISTICA 7.1, is used to develop four different feedforward-type ANN models: linear network, general regression neural network, radial basis function network, and multilayer perceptrons network (MLPN). In each of these models, the input layer consists of seven nodes, one node for each of the independent variables, namely moisture content (w), dry density (γd), plasticity index (PI), percent passing sieve No. 200 (P200), unconfined compressive strength (Uc), deviatoric stress (σd), and bulk stress (θ). The output layer consists of only one node—resilient modulus (MR). After the architecture is set, the development data set is fed into the model for training. The strengths and weaknesses of the developed models are examined by comparing the predicted MR values with the experimental values with respect to the R2 values. Overall, the MLPN model with two hidden layers was found to be the best model for the present development and evaluation data sets. This model as well as the other models could be refined using an enriched database.",

Predictive models of pavement distresses were developed based on the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) data and compared using support vector machine, random forest regression, gradient boosting machine, and stacking ensemble. Gradient boosting machine was found to be a more effective method to establish predictive models of rut depth and International Roughness Index. Stacking ensemble and random forest regression would provide reliable prediction of alligator cracking. The models developed based on the clusters of climate and traffic parameters were found to be more effective. Based on the developed performance models, the effects of asphalt overlays on pavement distresses and service lives were investigated. When the overlay with recycled asphalt concrete (AC) was applied, the propagation of alligator cracking was faster compared to the overlay with virgin asphalt mixture. Milling before overlay tended to slow the increase of IRI but fasten the development of rut depth.Keywords: Asphalt overlayclusteringdistresseslTPPmachine learningpavement performancerecycled asphalt concrete Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

Traffic data and field distress measurements were collected from the long-term pavement performance (LTPP) database. A random survival forest algorithm was used to establish predictive models of load-related pavement distresses considering traffic loading, pavement structure, and climate. The variable importance approach was used to select the appropriate variables in the model and reduce prediction error. The findings indicated that the explanatory variables related to axle load spectra and traffic loading were significant in explaining pavement performance degradation. The derived models were further applied to estimate the survival probability curves of asphalt pavement life at different loading scenarios and evaluate the impact of overweight traffic on the reduction of pavement life. The reduction ratio of pavement life due to alligator cracking resulting from overweight traffic was found to be greater than those due to longitudinal cracking and rutting for all the pavement sections. The study findings indicate that the proposed random survival forest model is a promising approach for quantifying the impact of traffic loading on pavement life considering axle load spectra characteristics.",

This study is based on the comparison of algorithms between individuals and ensemble approaches, such as bagging. Optimization for bagging is done by making 20 sub-models to depict the accurate one. Variables like cement content, fine and coarse aggregate, water, binder-to-water ratio, fly-ash, and superplasticizer are used for modeling. Model performance is evaluated by various statistical indicators like mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE). Individual algorithms show a moderate bias result. However, the ensemble model gives a better result with R2 = 0.911 compared to the decision tree (DT) and gene expression programming (GEP). K-fold cross-validation confirms the model’s accuracy and is done by R2, MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Statistical checks reveal that the decision tree with ensemble provides 25%, 121%, and 49% enhancement for errors like MAE, MSE, and RMSE between the target and outcome response.",

        "abstract": "In the present study, six meta-heuristic schemes are hybridized with artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system (ANFIS), and support vector machine (SVM), to predict monthly groundwater level (GWL), evaluate uncertainty analysis of predictions and spatial variation analysis. The six schemes, including grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), cat swarm optimization (CSO), weed algorithm (WA), genetic algorithm (GA), krill algorithm (KA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO), were used to hybridize for improving the performance of ANN, SVM, and ANFIS models. Groundwater level (GWL) data of Ardebil plain (Iran) for a period of 144 months were selected to evaluate the hybrid models. The pre-processing technique of principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce input combinations from monthly time series up to 12-month prediction intervals. The results showed that the ANFIS-GOA was superior to the other hybrid models for predicting GWL in the first piezometer (RMSE:1.21, MAE:0.878, NSE:0.93, PBIAS:0.15, R2:0.93), second piezometer (RMSE:1.22, MAE:0.881, NSE:0.92, PBIAS:0.17, R2:0.94), and third piezometer (RMSE:1.23, MAE:0.911, NSE:0.91, PBIAS:0.19, R2:0.94) in the testing stage. The performance of hybrid models with optimization algorithms was far better than that of classical ANN, ANFIS, and SVM models without hybridization. The percent of improvements in the ANFIS-GOA versus standalone ANFIS in piezometer 10 were 14.4%, 3%, 17.8%, and 181% for RMSE, MAE, NSE, and PBIAS in training stage and 40.7%, 55%, 25%, and 132% in testing stage, respectively. The improvements for piezometer 6 in train step were 15%, 4%, 13%, and 208% and in test step were 33%, 44.6%, 16.3%, and 173%, respectively, that clearly confirm the superiority of developed hybridization schemes in GWL modelling. Uncertainty analysis showed that ANFIS-GOA and SVM had, respectively, the best and worst performances among other models. In general, GOA enhanced the accuracy of the ANFIS, ANN, and SVM models.",

To achieve this objective, a boosting-CHAID technique was applied to a big experimental database comprising six input variables. The technique identified four input parameters (distance from blast-face, stemming length, powder factor, and maximum charge per delay) as the most significant parameters affecting the prediction accuracy and utilized them to propose the SVM models with various kernels. The kernel types used in this study include radial basis function, polynomial, sigmoid, and linear. Several criteria, including mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (R), and gains, were calculated to evaluate the developed models’ accuracy and applicability. In addition, a simple ranking system was used to evaluate the models’ performance systematically. The performance of the R and MAE index of the radial basis function kernel of SVM in training and testing phases, respectively, confirm the high capability of this SVM kernel in predicting PPV values. This study successfully demonstrates that a combination of boosting-CHAID and SVM models can identify and predict with a high level of accuracy the most effective parameters affecting PPV values.",

The time period has been the output parameter while the number of cross-bracing, column size, beam size, soft storey, irregularity coefficient and height of the building has been assigned as input parameters. The accuracy of machine learning techniques has been checked by reference to the formulas published in the literature.

        "abstract": "Geopolymer concrete could be the best alternative to ordinary Portland cement concrete due to its higher performance in any severe condition. It reduces the carbon footprints to a very higher level. Machine learning methods are the future of the construction industry because it predicts the mechanical strengths of concrete mix design on the basis of their constituents without destructive test conduction. This study is aimed at developing the models to predict the mechanical strengths and validate them with the actual results. After the experimental investigation, we found the results of the mechanical (including compressive, splitting tensile, and flexural tensile) strength. The M2 mix of geopolymer concrete got the highest mechanical strengths whereas the M5 mix gets the lowest mechanical strengths among all the mix designs. The machine learning methods ANN (artificial neural network) and random forest are used to develop the models based on mixed experimental results. Mechanical strength results are taken as outputs, and mixed constituents are taken as inputs for training and testing. The performance of predicted results is checked based on R 2 , MAE (mean absolute error), RMSE (relative mean square error), RAE (relative absolute error), and RRSE (root‐relative square error). Random forest models show the best prediction to the ANN models because it shows the negligible error between actual and predicted values. The R 2 value is 1 of 12 predicted results out of 15 by the use of random forest methods. So it is most suitable to predict the strength of geopolymer concrete based on their constituent’s material quantity.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent fault diagnosis can be related to applications of machine learning theories to machine fault diagnosis. Although there is a large number of successful examples, there is a gap in the optimization of the hyper-parameters of the machine learning model, which ultimately has a major impact on the performance of the model. Machine learning experts are required to configure a set of hyper-parameter values manually. This work presents a convolutional neural network based data-driven intelligent fault diagnosis technique for rotary machinery which uses model with optimized hyper-parameters and network structure. The proposed technique input raw three axes accelerometer signal as high definition 1-D data into deep learning layers with optimized hyper-parameters. Input is consisted of wide 12,800 × 1 × 3 vibration signal matrix. Model learning phase includes Bayesian optimization that optimizes hyper-parameters of the convolutional neural network. Finally, by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with optimized hyper-parameters, classification in one of the 8 different machine states and 2 rotational speeds can be performed. This study accomplished the effective classification of different rotary machinery states in different rotational speeds using optimized convolutional artificial neural network for classification of raw three axis accelerometer signal input. Overall classification accuracy of 99.94% on evaluation set is obtained with the CNN model based on 19 layers. Additionally, more data are collected on the same machine with altered bearings to test the model for overfitting. Result of classification accuracy of 100% on second evaluation set has been achieved, proving the potential of using the proposed technique.",

This study is aimed at providing a correlation between the structural performance and mechanical properties of carbon nano-tubes reinforced cementitious composites through efficient predictive Machine Learning (ML) models. The Flexural (FS) and Compressive (CS) Strength of Carbon Nanotube (CNT)-reinforced composites were predicted based on the data-rich framework provided in the literature. Two different ensembled ML methods including Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) were implemented on those data for predicting the CNT-reinforced cement-based composites. Data-set were utilized for training the proposed models through employing SciKit-Learn library in Python, followed by hyper-parameter tuning and k-fold cross-validation method for obtaining an optimum model to predict the target values. It was shown that the CS values predicted by the proposed models were more accurate than the FS counterparts and the developed model of GBM has less sensitivity to the alteration of test data than the proposed RF model. Finally, sensitivity analysis was conducted through Sobol algorithm and the parameters with highest contribution were identified.",

        "abstract": "Watershed models are powerful tools for simulating the effect of watershed processes and management on soil and water resources. However, no comprehensive guidance is available to facilitate model evaluation in terms of the accuracy of simulated data compared to measured flow and constituent values. Thus, the objectives of this research were to: (1) determine recommended model evaluation techniques (statistical and graphical), (2) review reported ranges of values and corresponding performance ratings for the recommended statistics, and (3) establish guidelines for model evaluation based on the review results and project-specific considerations; all of these objectives focus on simulation of streamflow and transport of sediment and nutrients. These objectives were achieved with a thorough review of relevant literature on model application and recommended model evaluation methods. Based on this analysis, we recommend that three quantitative statistics, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias (PBIAS), and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR), in addition to the graphical techniques, be used in model evaluation. The following model evaluation performance ratings were established for each recommended statistic. In general, model simulation can be judged as satisfactory if NSE > 0.50 and RSR < 0.70, and if PBIAS + 25% for streamflow, PBIAS + 55% for sediment, and PBIAS + 70% for N and P. For PBIAS, constituent-specific performance ratings were determined based on uncertainty of measured data. Additional considerations related to model evaluation guidelines are also discussed. These considerations include: single-event simulation, quality and quantity of measured data, model calibration procedure, evaluation time step, and project scope and magnitude. A case study illustrating the application of the model evaluation guidelines is also provided.",
