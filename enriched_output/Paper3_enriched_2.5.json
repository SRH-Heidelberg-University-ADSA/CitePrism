    "abstract": "This paper presents novel generalization bounds for vector-valued neural networks and deep kernel methods, focusing on multi-task learning through an operator-theoretic framework. Our key development lies in strategically combining a Koopman-based approach with existing techniques, achieving tighter generalization guarantees compared to traditional norm-based bounds. To mitigate computational challenges associated with Koopman-based methods, we introduce sketching techniques applicable to vector-valued neural networks. These techniques yield excess risk bounds under generic Lipschitz losses, providing performance guarantees for applications including robust and multiple quantile regression. Furthermore, we propose a novel deep learning framework—deep vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (vvRKHS)—leveraging Perron-Frobenius (PF) operators to enhance deep kernel methods. We derive a new Rademacher generalization bound for this framework, explicitly addressing underfitting and overfitting through kernel refinement strategies. This work offers novel insights into the generalization properties of multi-task learning with deep learning architectures, an area that has been relatively unexplored until recent developments."

        "abstract": "With the expansion of the internet, a major threat has emerged involving the spread of malicious domains intended by attackers to perform illegal activities aiming to target governments, violating privacy of organizations, and even manipulating everyday users. Therefore, detecting these harmful domains is necessary to combat the growing network attacks. Machine Learning (ML) models have shown significant outcomes towards the detection of malicious domains. However, the “black box” nature of the complex ML models obstructs their wide-ranging acceptance in some of the fields. The emergence of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has successfully incorporated the interpretability and explicability in the complex models. Furthermore, the post hoc XAI model has enabled the interpretability without affecting the performance of the models. This study aimed to propose an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) model to detect malicious domains on a recent dataset containing 45,000 samples of malicious and non-malicious domains. In the current study, initially several interpretable ML models, such as Decision Tree (DT) and Naïve Bayes (NB), and black box ensemble models, such as Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), AdaBoost (AB), and Cat Boost (CB) algorithms, were implemented and found that XGB outperformed the other classifiers. Furthermore, the post hoc XAI global surrogate model (Shapley additive explanations) and local surrogate LIME were used to generate the explanation of the XGB prediction. Two sets of experiments were performed; initially the model was executed using a preprocessed dataset and later with selected features using the Sequential Forward Feature selection algorithm. The results demonstrate that ML algorithms were able to distinguish benign and malicious domains with overall accuracy ranging from 0.8479 to 0.9856. The ensemble classifier XGB achieved the highest result, with an AUC and accuracy of 0.9991 and 0.9856, respectively, before the feature selection algorithm, while there was an AUC of 0.999 and accuracy of 0.9818 after the feature selection algorithm. The proposed model outperformed the benchmark study.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new point of view for regularizing deep neural networks by using the norm of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Even though this norm cannot be computed, it admits upper and lower approximations leading to various practical strategies. Specifically, this perspective (i) provides a common umbrella for many existing regularization principles, including spectral norm and gradient penalties, or adversarial training, (ii) leads to new effective regularization penalties, and (iii) suggests hybrid strategies combining lower and upper bounds to get better approximations of the RKHS norm. We experimentally show this approach to be effective when learning on small datasets, or to obtain adversarially robust models.",

        "abstract": "Point clouds provide a flexible geometric representation suitable for countless applications in computer graphics; they also comprise the raw output of most 3D data acquisition devices. While hand-designed features on point clouds have long been proposed in graphics and vision, however, the recent overwhelming success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN to the point cloud world. Point clouds inherently lack topological information, so designing a model to recover topology can enrich the representation power of point clouds. To this end, we propose a new neural network module dubbed EdgeConv suitable for CNN-based high-level tasks on point clouds, including classification and segmentation. EdgeConv acts on graphs dynamically computed in each layer of the network. It is differentiable and can be plugged into existing architectures. Compared to existing modules operating in extrinsic space or treating each point independently, EdgeConv has several appealing properties: It incorporates local neighborhood information; it can be stacked applied to learn global shape properties; and in multi-layer systems affinity in feature space captures semantic characteristics over potentially long distances in the original embedding. We show the performance of our model on standard benchmarks, including ModelNet40, ShapeNetPart, and S3DIS.",

Such approaches offer advantages like improved data efficiency, reduced overfitting through shared representations, and fast learning by leveraging auxiliary information. However, the simultaneous learning of multiple tasks presents new design and optimization challenges, and choosing which tasks should be learned jointly is in itself a non-trivial problem. In this survey, we give an overview of multi-task learning methods for deep neural networks, with the aim of summarizing both the well-established and most recent directions within the field. Our discussion is structured according to a partition of the existing deep MTL techniques into three groups: architectures, optimization methods, and task relationship learning. We also provide a summary of common multi-task benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Kernel methods are learning algorithms that enjoy solid theoretical foundations while suffering from important computational limitations. Sketching, which consists in looking for solutions among a subspace of reduced dimension, is a well studied approach to alleviate these computational burdens. However, statistically-accurate sketches, such as the Gaussian one, usually contain few null entries, such that their application to kernel methods and their non-sparse Gram matrices remains slow in practice. In this paper, we show that sparsified Gaussian (and Rademacher) sketches still produce theoretically-valid approximations while allowing for important time and space savings thanks to an efficient \\emph{decomposition trick}. To support our method, we derive excess risk bounds for both single and multiple output kernel problems, with generic Lipschitz losses, hereby providing new guarantees for a wide range of applications, from robust regression to multiple quantile regression. Our theoretical results are complemented with experiments showing the empirical superiority of our approach over SOTA sketching methods.",

We derive a new Rademacher generalization bound in this setting and provide a theoretical interpretation of benign overfitting by means of Perron-Frobenius operators. By virtue of $C^*$-algebra, the dependency of the bound on output dimension is milder than existing bounds. We show that $C^*$-algebra is a suitable tool for deep learning with kernels, enabling us to take advantage of the product structure of operators and to provide a clear connection with convolutional neural networks. Our theoretical analysis provides a new lens through which one can design and analyze deep kernel methods.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new bound for generalization of neural networks using Koopman operators. Whereas most of existing works focus on low-rank weight matrices, we focus on full-rank weight matrices. Our bound is tighter than existing norm-based bounds when the condition numbers of weight matrices are small. Especially, it is completely independent of the width of the network if the weight matrices are orthogonal. Our bound does not contradict to the existing bounds but is a complement to the existing bounds. As supported by several existing empirical results, low-rankness is not the only reason for generalization. Furthermore, our bound can be combined with the existing bounds to obtain a tighter bound. Our result sheds new light on understanding generalization of neural networks with full-rank weight matrices, and it provides a connection between operator-theoretic analysis and generalization of neural networks.",

Borrowing tools and concepts from the field of quantum computing, such as partial trace and entanglement, we propose a new view on operator-valued kernels and define a general family of kernels that encompasses previously known operator-valued kernels, including separable and transformable kernels. Within this framework, we introduce another novel class of operator-valued kernels called entangled kernels that are not separable. We propose an efficient two-step algorithm for this framework, where the entangled kernel is learned based on a novel extension of kernel alignment to operator-valued kernels.

        "abstract": "At initialization, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are equivalent to Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit, thus connecting them to kernel methods. We prove that the evolution of an ANN during training can also be described by a kernel: during gradient descent on the parameters of an ANN, the network function $f_θ$ (which maps input vectors to output vectors) follows the kernel gradient of the functional cost (which is convex, in contrast to the parameter cost) w.r.t. a new kernel: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This kernel is central to describe the generalization features of ANNs. While the NTK is random at initialization and varies during training, in the infinite-width limit it converges to an explicit limiting kernel and it stays constant during training. This makes it possible to study the training of ANNs in function space instead of parameter space. Convergence of the training can then be related to the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK. We prove the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK when the data is supported on the sphere and the non-linearity is non-polynomial. We then focus on the setting of least-squares regression and show that in the infinite-width limit, the network function $f_θ$ follows a linear differential equation during training. The convergence is fastest along the largest kernel principal components of the input data with respect to the NTK, hence suggesting a theoretical motivation for early stopping. Finally we study the NTK numerically, observe its behavior for wide networks, and compare it to the infinite-width limit.",

We study the generalization properties of fine-tuning to understand the problem of overfitting, which has often been observed (e.g., when the target dataset is small or when the training labels are noisy). Existing generalization measures for deep networks depend on notions such as distance from the initialization (i.e., the pretrained network) of the fine-tuned model and noise stability properties of deep networks. This paper identifies a Hessian-based distance measure through PAC-Bayesian analysis, which is shown to correlate well with observed generalization gaps of fine-tuned models. Theoretically, we prove Hessian distance-based generalization bounds for fine-tuned models. We also describe an extended study of fine-tuning against label noise, where overfitting remains a critical problem. We present an algorithm and a generalization error guarantee for this algorithm under a class conditional independent noise model. Empirically, we observe that the Hessian-based distance measure can match the scale of the observed generalization gap of fine-tuned models in practice. We also test our algorithm on several image classification tasks with noisy training labels, showing gains over prior methods and decreases in the Hessian distance measure of the fine-tuned model.",

Assuming that the observations lie in a Hilbert space X, the introduced Kernel Autoencoder (KAE) is the composition of mappings from vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (vv-RKHSs) that minimizes the expected reconstruction error. Beyond a first extension of the autoencoding scheme to possibly infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, KAE further allows to autoencode any kind of data by choosing X to be itself a RKHS. A theoretical analysis of the model is carried out, providing a generalization bound, and shedding light on its connection with Kernel Principal Component Analysis. The proposed algorithms are then detailed at length: they crucially rely on the form taken by the minimizers, revealed by a dedicated Representer Theorem. Finally, numerical experiments on both simulated data and real labeled graphs (molecules) provide empirical evidence of the KAE performances.",

We combine standard assumptions on the capacity of the hypothesis space with a novel tensor product construction of vector-valued interpolation spaces in order to characterize the smoothness of the regression function. Our upper bound not only attains the same rate as real-valued kernel ridge regression, but also removes the assumption that the target regression function is bounded. For the lower bound, we reduce the problem to the scalar setting using a projection argument. We show that these rates are optimal in most cases and independent of the dimension of the output space.

We tackle these problems and provide the first unified risk analysis of learning with random Fourier features using the squared error and Lipschitz continuous loss functions. In our bounds, the trade-off between the computational cost and the learning risk convergence rate is problem specific and expressed in terms of the regularization parameter and the number of effective degrees of freedom. We study both the standard random Fourier features method for which we improve the existing bounds on the number of features required to guarantee the corresponding minimax risk convergence rate of kernel ridge regression, as well as a data-dependent modification which samples features proportional to ridge leverage scores and further reduces the required number of features. As ridge leverage scores are expensive to compute, we devise a simple approximation scheme which provably reduces the computational cost without loss of statistical efficiency. Our empirical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme relative to the standard random Fourier features method.",

        "abstract": "Randomized algorithms for very large matrix problems have received a great deal of attention in recent years.Much of this work was motivated by problems in large-scale data analysis, largely since matrices are popular structures with which to model data drawn from a wide range of application domains, and this work was performed by individuals from many different research communities.While the most obvious benefit of randomization is that it can lead to faster algorithms, either in worst-case asymptotic theory and/or numerical implementation, there are numerous other benefits that are at least as important.For example, the use of randomization can lead to simpler algorithms that are easier to analyze or reason about when applied in counterintuitive settings; it can lead to algorithms with more interpretable output, which is of interest in applications where analyst time rather than just computational time is of interest; it can lead implicitly to regularization and more robust output; and randomized algorithms can often be organized to exploit modern computational architectures better than classical numerical methods.This monograph will provide a detailed overview of recent work on the theory of randomized matrix algorithms as well as the application of those ideas to the solution of practical problems in large-scale data analysis.Throughout this review, an emphasis will be placed on a few simple core ideas that underlie not only recent theoretical advances but also the usefulness of these tools in large-scale data applications.Crucial in this context is the connection with the concept of statistical leverage.This concept has long been used in statistical regression diagnostics to identify outliers; and it has recently proved crucial in the development of improved worst-case matrix algorithms that are also amenable to high-quality numerical implementation and that are useful to domain scientists.This connection arises naturally when one explicitly decouples the effect of randomization in these matrix algorithms from the underlying linear algebraic structure.This decoupling also permits much finer control in the application of randomization, as well as the easier exploitation of domain knowledge.Most of the review will focus on random sampling algorithms and random projection algorithms for versions of the linear least-squares problem and the low-rank matrix approximation problem.These two problems are fundamental in theory and ubiquitous in practice.Randomized methods solve these problems by constructing and operating on a randomized sketch of the input matrix Afor random sampling methods, the sketch consists of a small number of carefully-sampled and rescaled columns/rows of A, while for random projection methods, the sketch consists of a small number of linear combinations of the columns/rows of A. Depending on the specifics of the situation, when compared with the best previously-existing deterministic algorithms, the resulting randomized algorithms have worst-case running time that is asymptotically faster; their numerical implementations are faster in terms of clock-time; or they can be implemented in parallel computing environments where existing numerical algorithms fail to run at all.Numerous examples illustrating these observations will be described in detail.",

        "abstract": "An important goal in visual recognition is to devise image representations that are invariant to particular transformations. In this paper, we address this goal with a new type of convolutional neural network (CNN) whose invariance is encoded by a reproducing kernel. Unlike traditional approaches where neural networks are learned either to represent data or for solving a classification task, our network learns to approximate the kernel feature map on training data. Such an approach enjoys several benefits over classical ones. First, by teaching CNNs to be invariant, we obtain simple network architectures that achieve a similar accuracy to more complex ones, while being easy to train and robust to overfitting. Second, we bridge a gap between the neural network literature and kernels, which are natural tools to model invariance. We evaluate our methodology on visual recognition tasks where CNNs have proven to perform well, e.g., digit recognition with the MNIST dataset, and the more challenging CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets, where our accuracy is competitive with the state of the art.",

In this paper, we use techniques from random matrix theory to characterize the spectral distribution of the empirical feature covariance matrix as a width-dependent perturbation of the spectrum of the neural network Gaussian process (NNGP) kernel, thus establishing a novel connection between the NNGP literature and the random matrix theory literature in the context of neural networks. Our analytical expressions allow us to explore the generalisation behavior of the corresponding kernel and GP regression. Furthermore, they offer a new interpretation of double-descent in terms of the discrepancy between the width-dependent empirical kernel and the width-independent NNGP kernel.",

In this setting, we derive the form of the minimal norm interpolant to a finite set of data and apply it to study some regularization functionals that are important in learning theory. We consider specific examples of such functionals corresponding to multiple-output regularization networks and support vector machines, for both regression and classification.

        "abstract": "Foundations of Machine LearningSoon we will embark on a theoretical study of AdaBoost in order to understand its properties, particularly its ability as a learning algorithm to generalize, that is, to make accurate predictions on data not seen during training.Before this will be possible, however, it will be necessary to take a step back to outline our approach to the more general problem of machine learning, including some fundamental general-purpose tools that will be invaluable in our analysis of AdaBoost.We study the basic problem of inferring from a set of training examples a classification rule whose predictions are highly accurate on freshly observed test data.On first encounter, it may seem questionable whether this kind of learning should even be possible.After all, why should there be any connection between the training and test examples, and why should it be possible to generalize from a relatively small number of training examples to a potentially vast universe of test examples?Although such objections have indeed often been the subject of philosophical debate, in this chapter we will identify an idealized but realistic model of the inference problem in which this kind of learning can be proved to be entirely feasible when certain conditions are satisfied.In particular, we will see that if we can find a simple rule that fits the training data well, and if the training set is not too small, then this rule will in fact generalize well, providing accurate predictions on previously unseen test examples.This is the basis of the approach presented in this chapter, and we will often use the general analysis on which it is founded to guide us in understanding how, why, and when learning is possible.We also outline in this chapter a mathematical framework for studying machine learning, one in which a precise formulation of the boosting problem can be clearly and naturally expressed.Note that, unlike the rest of the book, this chapter omits nearly all of the proofs of the main results since these have largely all appeared in various texts and articles.",

One crucial aspect of these models is an expectation that, because they are treated as Gaussian process models optimized using the marginal likelihood, they are protected from overfitting. However, we identify situations where this is not the case. We explore this behavior, explain its origins and consider how it applies to real datasets. Through careful experimentation on the UCI, CIFAR-10, and the UTKFace datasets, we find that the overfitting from overparameterized maximum marginal likelihood, in which the model is \"somewhat Bayesian\", can in certain scenarios be worse than that from not being Bayesian at all. We explain how and when DKL can still be successful by investigating optimization dynamics. We also find that failures of DKL can be rectified by a fully Bayesian treatment, which leads to the desired performance improvements over standard neural networks and Gaussian processes.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework for the analysis of vector-valued neural networks through the development of vector-valued variation spaces, a new class of reproducing kernel Banach spaces. These spaces emerge from studying the regularization effect of weight decay in training networks with activations like the rectified linear unit (ReLU). This framework offers a deeper understanding of multi-output networks and their function-space characteristics. A key contribution of this work is the development of a representer theorem for the vector-valued variation spaces. This representer theorem establishes that shallow vector-valued neural networks are the solutions to data-fitting problems over these infinite-dimensional spaces, where the network widths are bounded by the square of the number of training data. This observation reveals that the norm associated with these vector-valued variation spaces encourages the learning of features that are useful for multiple tasks, shedding new light on multi-task learning with neural networks. Finally, this paper develops a connection between weight-decay regularization and the multi-task lasso problem. This connection leads to novel bounds for layer widths in deep networks that depend on the intrinsic dimensions of the training data representations. This insight not only deepens the understanding of the deep network architectural requirements, but also yields a simple convex optimization method for deep neural network compression.

This framework allows a broad class of mixed norm regularizers, including those that induce sparsity, to be imposed on a dictionary of vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. We develop a highly scalable and eigendecomposition-free algorithm that orchestrates two inexact solvers for simultaneously learning both the input and output components of separable matrix-valued kernels. As a key application enabled by our framework, we show how high-dimensional causal inference tasks can be naturally cast as sparse function estimation problems, leading to novel nonlinear extensions of a class of Graphical Granger Causality techniques. Our algorithmic developments and extensive empirical studies are complemented by theoretical analyses in terms of Rademacher generalization bounds.",

        "abstract": "One of the biggest issues in deep learning theory is the generalization ability of networks with huge model size. The classical learning theory suggests that overparameterized models cause overfitting. However, practically used large deep models avoid overfitting, which is not well explained by the classical approaches. To resolve this issue, several attempts have been made. Among them, the compression based bound is one of the promising approaches. However, the compression based bound can be applied only to a compressed network, and it is not applicable to the non-compressed original network. In this paper, we give a unified frame-work that can convert compression based bounds to those for non-compressed original networks. The bound gives even better rate than the one for the compressed network by improving the bias term. By establishing the unified frame-work, we can obtain a data dependent generalization error bound which gives a tighter evaluation than the data independent ones.",

Much of the expensive computation can then be performed on the smaller matrix, thereby accelerating the solution for the original problem. In this survey we consider least squares as well as robust regression problems, low rank approximation, and graph sparsification. We also discuss a number of variants of these problems. Finally, we discuss the limitations of sketching methods.",

Given $n$ samples, the time and space complexity of computing the KRR estimate scale as $\\\\mathcal{O}(n^{3})$ and $\\\\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$, respectively, and so is prohibitive in many cases. We propose approximations of KRR based on $m$-dimensional randomized sketches of the kernel matrix, and study how small the projection dimension $m$ can be chosen while still preserving minimax optimality of the approximate KRR estimate. For various classes of randomized sketches, including those based on Gaussian and randomized Hadamard matrices, we prove that it suffices to choose the sketch dimension $m$ proportional to the statistical dimension (modulo logarithmic factors). Thus, we obtain fast and minimax optimal approximations to the KRR estimate for nonparametric regression. In doing so, we prove a novel lower bound on the minimax risk of kernel regression in terms of the localized Rademacher complexity.",

We also give a new bound on the LRC for any norm regularized hypothesis classes, which applies not only to MTL, but also to the standard Single-Task Learning (STL) setting. By combining both results, one can easily derive fast-rate bounds on the excess risk for many prominent MTL methods, including-as we demonstrate-Schatten norm, group norm, and graph regularized MTL. The derived bounds reflect a relationship akin to a conservation law of asymptotic convergence rates. When compared to the rates obtained via a traditional, global Rademacher analysis, this very relationship allows for trading off slower rates with respect to the number of tasks for faster rates with respect to the number of available samples per task.",

The study is motivated from the need of updating the current operator-valued reproducing kernel in multi-task learning when underfitting or overfitting occurs. Numerical simulations confirm that the established refinement kernel method is able to meet this need. Various characterizations are provided based on feature maps and vector-valued integral representations of operator-valued reproducing kernels. Concrete examples of refining translation invariant and finite Hilbert-Schmidt operator-valued reproducing kernels are provided. Other examples include refinement of Hessian of scalar-valued translation-invariant kernels and transformation kernels. Existence and properties of operator-valued reproducing kernels preserved during the refinement process are also investigated.",
