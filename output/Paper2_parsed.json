PC is a finite resource that necessitates a substantial quantity of energy and is deliberated a vital constituent of cementitious matrix. Concrete, a cementitious composite is considered one of the main sources of CO 2 in the atmosphere. Thus, approximately considered for about seven percent of CO 2 emissions around the entire globe [12] . Additionally, its demand is increasing as a result of the ad- vancements in modern construction projects such as dams, long bridges, etc [13,14] . In addition, concrete is characterized by a low strain ca- pacity and a relatively low strength at initial load. However, there exists porous media inside the matrix, and increasing the load causes cracks [15] . Therefore, the mechanical aspect of the composite matrix is significantly diminished leading to reduced strength. Consequently, their inclusion in the composite medium enhances the strength and provides an adamant hindrance to cracking [16] . The exceptional performance of nanotechnology in various domains has garnered global interest [17 – 20] . Nanoparticles (NPs) are charac- terized by dimensions ranging from 1 to 100 nm. Nanomaterials (NMs) boost the strength and longevity of the material, while also improving hydration processes and reducing pressure on formwork [21 – 23] . Nanomaterials catalyze the formation of nucleation, resulting in the production of compact and less permeable CSH-hydrated products. Furthermore, the process of hydration involves a chemical reaction be- tween NPs and calcium hydroxide, known as the pozzolanic reaction. This reaction leads to the expansion of CSH hydration products that leads to fills of the available voids due to dense structure [24 – 27] . A structure with reduced porosity and increased density is formed, resulting in enhanced mechanical strength and durability [28 – 30] . Moreover, the small size of the concrete reinforcing material enhances its effectiveness in impeding fracture growth. Thus, reinforcement nanoparticles such as Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and nanomaterials in cementitious composites have received significant attention for this reason. GNPs have attracted significant attention because of the distinct features associated with their tiny structure [31 – 33] . 1.1. Literature review A wide range of nanoparticles has been incorporated in cementitious matrix (CM) since the advent of nanotechnology. Nanomaterials have the strength and ability to enhance the resilience and efficacy with durability of concrete [34 – 36] . The addition of NPs to composite me- dium is primarily intended to enhance the microstructure of the cementitious component. Furthermore, the utilization of nanotech- nology has garnered substantial interest in recent years, as depicted in Fig. 1 . Nanoparticles enhance the bulk characteristics of concrete by opti- mizing the packing model structure. Ultra or Nanoparticles can enhance the filler effect by improving the intersectional zone (ITZ) in cement and increasing the density of concrete [37 – 39] . Their manipulation or alteration in the cement matrix system occurs to create a new nanoscale structure by serving as an effective filler. NMs transform as they shoulder the role of novel binding agents that are smaller in size compared to cement particles [40,41] . This enhances the configuration Fig. 1.

Furthermore, researchers have successfully created a novel type of concrete known as Nano concrete due to by incorporation of NPs that act as fillers and additional chemical reactions inside the hydration system [45 – 51] .

Necessity of machine learning in civil engineering Concrete is widely used worldwide as a construction material due to its notable advantages, such as cost-effectiveness, consistency, versa- tility, and durability [72 – 75] . Moreover, evaluating the mechanical characteristics of concrete is crucial for determining effective design strategies and the durability of structures against external forces. Also, the timely availability of experimental test findings is essential for the goal of minimizing costs and saving time [76 – 78] . To carry out studies, whether on-site or in a laboratory, advanced equipment must be used. As a result, a significant amount of work is required, making it economi- cally impractical [79] . In addition, it is also vital and essential to have a specific area allocated for the storage and curing of concrete samples during testing. Therefore, leading to a rise in its financial ramifications. Furthermore, a substantial amount of time is required to perform a thorough analysis of the impact of certain components of concrete, such Fig. 2. Advantages of ML in concrete.",

Thus, the distribution of these elements within the concrete mixture is random [81 – 83] . Evaluating the capa- bility of concrete to endure compressive forces within a composite framework is a more demanding task. Therefore, precisely predicting the longevity of the concrete in a composite matrix is a challenging endeavor. To cater to these limitations, researchers suggested various correlations to assess the CS of the composite matrix in different labo- ratory conditions. These relations are predominantly established to calculate the CS of the cementitious matrix. Therefore, relying on this approach is impractical when handling different types of components in",

Therefore, it is crucial to choose suitable algorithms. The dataset con- sists of 172 entries, comprising raw materials that are defined by their sand content, GNP diameter, thickness, and GNP content. In addition, the dataset also includes information on the GNP dispersion process, which involves the use of ultra-sonication, as well as the curing age. The dependent variable is the compressive strength of GNP. Thoroughly explaining these variables aids in recognizing pertinent characteristics and comprehending the connections among them, resulting in more precise and efficient construction of models. The correlation between the strength and the stated parameters was examined using Python metrics. Moreover, the command \"VAC.describe(). T\" is utilized to construct descriptive statistics that offer a concise overview of the mean, variability, and distribution pattern of a dataset. The command Fig. 6.

The \"percentiles\" of the data frame offer a specific perspective on the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th per- centiles and the maximum values for each variable in your dataset. The percentiles provide valuable insights into the distribution of each vari- able. Thus, allowing for the identification of the central tendency and the spread of the data points, as depicted in Fig. 3 . Fig. 4 displays the correlation heat map between CS and the input components. A negative correlation implies that as the amount of sand increases, the compressive strength generally decreases. Nevertheless, the association between sand content and compressive strength is feeble, indicating that sand content does not exert a significant influence on compressive strength. This phenomenon may be attributed to the pos- sibility that an increased sand content could potentially weaken the binding characteristics of the cement, resulting in a less robust com- posite material. A moderate positive correlation indicates that there is a direct relationship between the increase in GNP thickness and the rise in compressive strength. Increasing the thickness of GNPs could enhance their ability to reinforce the material and enhance its structural integ- rity. Thus, resulting in greater strength. The presence of a weak negative association indicates that an increase in GNP content has a slight detrimental effect on compressive strength. This may occur due to an abundance of GNPs, which can result in the clumping together or inadequate spread of the particles inside the matrix. Hence, adversely impacting the mechanical characteristics of the material. Furthermore, the utilization of ultra-sonication can facilitate the uniform dispersion of GNPs throughout the matrix, hence raising the material ’ s homogeneity and marginally augmenting its strength. A moderate positive correlation suggests that there is a connection between longer curing durations and better compressive strength. During the curing process, the material",

Machine learning overview Machine learning is commonly used to predict the behavior of ma- terials and other properties in the concrete matrix [108,109] . The strength of a nanocomposite (GNPs) is predicted by using four algo- rithms namely XGB, LGB, KNN, and ANN. These techniques are well acknowledged for their outstanding performance and ability to precisely identify the attributes of properties [110 – 112] . Furthermore, Fig. 6 depicts the ML approaches employed in our research, while Fig. 7 pro- vides a detailed flowchart of MLA employed and input parameters. Furthermore, XGB, KNN, LGB, and ANN possess unique benefits when it comes to managing difficult datasets and collecting complex patterns. XGB and LGB were selected due to their outstanding performance in handling big datasets with high-dimensional features, their capacity to address overfitting, and their efficiency in managing missing data [113 – 115] . KNN was chosen for its simplicity and robustness in analyzing local data structures, making it a useful benchmark for com- parison [116 – 118] . ANN was chosen for its robust ability to simulate non-linear connections and capture intricate patterns. By utilizing this varied range of models, our objective was to exploit their unique Fig. 8. Extreme gradient boosting prediction process. T.S. Alahmari and K. Arif Materials Today Communications 40 (2024) 109946 7 capabilities to attain strong predicted accuracy and obtain a full un- derstanding of the data, guaranteeing that our research was meticulous and trustworthy [119 – 121] . 2.2.1. Extreme gradient boosting XGB model was created as an extension of Friedman ’ s original \"Gradient Boosting Machine\" model [122] . XGB is a powerful and robust algorithm that can effectively construct ensembles of decision trees, which collaborate and can solve both problems based on classification, and regression. The fundamental issue of this algorithm is to maximize the value of the objective function (OF). Moreover, it applies ML",

The XGB algo- rithm employs a particular technique known as gradient boosting (GB) with regularization, which tackles problems to mitigate overfitting [123 – 125] . Furthermore, the OF is the addition of all the key index, and the loss function. The loss function measures the difference between values between the experimental and predicted one. While, the regula- rization factor penalizes the complexity of models. Moreover, Fig. 8 il- lustrates the entire prediction process of XGB. Initially, the model begins by employing a solitary decision tree. Next, calculate the errors (dis- crepancies) between the model values and with actual values. Once the error has been calculated, a new decision tree is trained specifically to rectify the faults created by the prior decision tree. Additionally, a novel tree is incorporated into the collection, and the assessed values are Fig. 9. Histogram-based decision tree. Fig. 10. Construction of decision tree. T.S. Alahmari and K.

Light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) Light GBM is a kind of Gradient Boosting Decision Tree that is based on a decision-tree algorithm developed by Microsoft Research [126 – 128] . Light GBM is a robust method for addressing regression, classification, and other machine-learning problems. It utilizes less memory and surpasses in terms of prediction accuracy. The objective is to enhance computational performance to more efficiently tackle com- plex data prediction issues [129] . The Light GBM algorithm incorporates two novel techniques: gradient-based one-side sampling (GOSS), designed to handle huge datasets, and exclusive features bundling (EFB), aimed at managing a large number of data features without overfitting issues. Light GBM improves training and reduces memory usage by utilizing the histogram method and the tree leaf-wise growth strategy. The following decimal numbers are partitioned into smaller categories. Subsequently, the histogram is constructed using these bins, taking into account their width. The necessary statistics (sum of gradients and count of samples in each bin) are obtained from the histogram during the initial examination of the data. The optimal segmentation point can be ascertained by analyzing the discrete value of the histogram [130 – 132] . This strategy can help decrease the expenses associated with storage and measurement. Fig. 9 illustrates the level-wise and leaf-wise development approaches. According to the level-wise growth technique, the leaves on the same layer are divided simultaneously. It is more advantageous to optimize using a large number of threads while also managing the complexity of the model. In addition, the leaves on the same layer are thoroughly processed, even though they possess distinct information acquisition. The information gain quantifies the expected reduction in entropy that occurs when the nodes are divided based on properties that may be inferred [133] . The leaf-wise development strategy is very effective since it only divides the leaf with the highest information gain at the same level Fig. 10 . Moreover, by employing this method, it is possible to generate trees with a significant level of complexity; however, to prevent the model from becoming too specialized for the training data, a maximum depth restriction is enforced throughout the construction of the tree [133] . 2.2.3. K-nearest neighbor K closest neighbor (KNN) is a method that involves making pre- dictions for new data points by comparing them to the most comparable records in a collection. Fig. 11 depicts schematic representations of KNN algorithms. Both regression and classification techniques in machine learning can be utilized. The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm Fig. 11.

Alahmari and K. Arif Materials Today Communications 40 (2024) 109946 9 assumes that observations that are proximate in the attribute space (i.e., concrete mix) are also proximate in the output value space [134] . The anticipated output values are determined by a predetermined function that considers the response value of the nearest neighbor in the data space. In the case of standard KNN, the average function is typically employed [134] . The properties of a standard K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm are as follows: 1. Apply equal weighting to all neigh- boring observations and utilize the average function to determine the response value of unknown data; 2. Assign equal weighting to all characteristics by assuming that all normalized attributes hold equal significance; 3. Employ Euclidean distances to compute the distance [135] . KNN has the advantage of being less influenced by noise present in the training data, making it a useful algorithm for handling enormous volumes of training data. 2.2.4. Artificial neural network ANNs are complex systems consisting of interconnected components that function in parallel to solve complex issues by deploying artificial neurons [136 – 138] . An artificial neural network (ANN) is a statistical learning system that draws inspiration from biological neural networks. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is comprised of a multitude of intricately linked neurons. The architecture of artificial neural net- works (ANNs) is based on the structure and operation of biological neural networks [139] . An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) consists of neurons that are structured into numerous layers, mirroring the orga- nization of neurons in the human brain. The feedforward neural network is a commonly encountered type of neural network that comprises three layers: an input layer for receiving external data necessary for pattern recognition, an output layer for producing the response, and a hidden layer that connects the other layers [140] . Acyclic arcs connect neigh- boring neurons in the input and output layers. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) employs a training technique to acquire information from datasets [141] .

In contrast, inade- quately selected hyper-parameters might result in unsatisfactory per- formance, overfitting, or under-fitting [143] . Hyper-parameter tuning entails employing systematic search and optimization approaches to determine the optimal parameter configuration for a certain model and dataset. This process guarantees that the model attains its maximum potential and produces dependable and resilient outcomes. Table 3 displays the comprehensive adjustment of the parameters.",
